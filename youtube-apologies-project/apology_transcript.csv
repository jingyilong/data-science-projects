001_Austin,"Hi guys, and now a lot of you probably have some really harsh and negative opinions towards me right now, and I understand why you do. But I'm asking you to please put those opinions aside for a few minutes, and listen to everything I have to say. And if by the end of the video you still have the same opinion, then so be it. But at least you will have your opinion based off of the full story and the truth. I've recently come under some fire on social media for mistakes I've made in the past. I used to ask fans for twerking videos. Yes, twerking the dance move. It's not something that I'm proud of. It's not something that I think is right, and I shouldn't have done it. This really blew up online when a YouTuber and someone that's very popular on social media somehow found this out and decided to blast it out there. I'm not going to say any names because I've come under attack on social media from my name being spread around. And I don't want to put that on anyone else. So throughout this story, I'm not going to say any names. It really blew up online. And something down a path that is pretty scary. I don't go into more detail about this. But first, what I want to do is set the record straight. Since this started online, there are a lot of rumors and a lot of lies. They're just not true. Nothing ever went further than twerking videos. They were never any news, never any physical contact. It never happened. So I just have to get that out there because nothing ever went further. Now, I was on tour at the time that this came out. This was in May. This was early May. I was on the road when the scape laughs it out there. We were in Boston. It was in the middle of the night. And when this happened, I made the decision to come home from tour. I knew that I couldn't be on the road under this stress, under this pressure, under all of this drama and controversy online. It wasn't something that I could emotionally handle. A lot of people ask, why did the initial statement take so long to get up? I put up a text statement and apology addressing the situation, but it took me about a week to do so. People thought that I was being a coward. People thought that I didn't want to confront the situation. They thought that I was just blowing it off. That's not true. As I said, I was on the road. I was on tour. We were all the way in Boston. We had to make the drive all the way back from Boston to Chicago. On that drive, the only thing I did was look at my phone and look at all the hate and death threats. I got lost in it. I would read every little comment, every little person telling me to kill myself, every person telling me that life wasn't worth living for me anymore. I'm a pretty insecure person to wear negative comments like that really impact me. It's not something I can just brush off and that entire ride home. I read those comments and I began researching different suicide methods. I started planning my suicide. It's something I was very, very serious about and I was determined to do. I finally got home. When we got back, I didn't even step foot in my house. My family took me immediately to the hospital and I was hospitalized for my suicidal tendencies. They were very worried and I understand whether or not they were. I had never been hospitalized before for my depression or my past self-harm or my suicidal thoughts. This was the first time and maybe I'll open up about it in a separate video but this was a very, very interesting and emotional experience for me. No, I wasn't cowering. I wasn't avoiding the situation. I was in a hospital. I had no internet connection. I had no connection to social media so I couldn't put out a statement. I wanted to apologize. I wanted to confront it immediately but I couldn't. As soon as I got out of the hospital, the next day that's when I put it up. That's why the initial statement took so long to get out. What I want to do is tell you guys a little bit about my life. I'm not doing this looking for sympathy. I'm not doing this to guilt anybody. I'm not doing this to play the victim card. These aren't excuses for my actions because I don't believe there are excuses for my actions. What I did was wrong. It's plain and simple and there's no excuse for it. But the biggest question I get asked is why? Why did this happen? Why did I ask for those things? In order to figure out why, you have to look at the reasons. The reasons lie in my past and in what I've experienced through life and how I even got to that point. This is just a little bit about my life. I'm not going to dive too deep into it to keep this video short. I experienced death and loss at a very young age. I had an older sister. She passed away when she was 10 years old. I was 6 years old at the time. Losing a sibling for anybody is tragic. Going through it at such a young age was very difficult for me. Though I barely knew her, I miss her a lot to this day. I really do. I went through a series of funerals when I was very young. Most were distant relatives that I either didn't even know at all or had only seen on a few occasions. But I was so young that I really didn't know who they were. I was going to so many funerals that as a kid, I began to associate dress shoes with funerals. It's the only time I dressed up. That's how much death I was experiencing at such a young age is that I thought that dress shoes were only worn when people died. My father is another topic I want to dive into. I barely saw my father. My parents divorced at a very, very young age. The last time I saw him was when I was 8 years old. My father was an alcoholic and a drug addict. He couldn't get control of his life because of it. I have a deeper connection with my father. I have two brothers, both of which don't look as much like my dad as I do. I act the most like my dad. There are some deeper emotional struggles that I have with my father and with the relationship with my father. The last time I saw him was when I was 8. He passed away when I was 16. I didn't see him any other time. I passed when I was 8 years old. His addiction got the best of him. When I was 16, a few months before he passed away, my family and I went through a house fire. We were away visiting relatives and somebody broke into our house, stole some things and burned the entire house down. Now I know it sounds not as bad as it feels because we lost things. We didn't lose people at that time. My life was completely uprooted. I lost everything. I lost my entire house. It was a huge change of pace. Everything that we had to remember family by, any photos of my sister or my father were gone. It was tough. Within that same few month time span, about a month after my father passed away, my grandfather passed away. I was very close to my grandfather. He was the last of my living grandparents that I was close to, biologically. Yeah, it was a really tough six months. That's when after that happened. That's when I began self-harming. I used to cut my wrists. I'm over three years clean of that now. Something that I'm very proud of. All of these life events, all of these deaths, this loss left me with really deep, deep depression. I was an insecure, depressed guy and I began searching for attention in the wrong ways. Looking for those things. It was because I was desperate for attention. I was desperate for reassurance. I wanted to feel good about myself. At the time, I thought it was just fun and goofy. I was young. I was stupid. I wasn't thinking clearly. Over time, I began to see it was wrong and I shouldn't have done it. That's why it happened. Like I said, doesn't excuse my actions, doesn't justify it. That's not why I told you all of that. I told you it so that you would understand why I was desperate, why I was even asking for those things. It was that depression piling up into me searching for attention. Sorry. It's a lot to talk about and I really want to stand subject. So something else that I want to talk about is people saying that you're only sorry that you got caught. You apologize because you got caught. You don't actually feel sorry that's so far from the truth. This has been something that's eaten me alive for quite some time. The guilt has been piling up for months. I mean, it's a constant guilt. It just, it sits and fester is in my stomach and it wouldn't go away. This is before it became public a month ago. This is something that I've regretted for a long time. There are a few actual examples that show that. Before I went on tour, on my last tour, a few months ago, I started going back to therapy for this specific reason because I regretted it so much and I couldn't move past it. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I couldn't stop feeling like absolute shit for what I had done. So I went back to therapy before I left for tour. Also a few months before this became public, I talked to a couple of my co-workers, if you want to call them that. One of which is very popular online. If you're part of this specific music scene, you'd know exactly who he is if I told you who he was. So this is a pretty big and I'd like to consider a reputable man. I went to him with this. I told him my entire past. I told him that I felt so guilty for this and that I regret it and that I wanted to confess all of this in the video. Some clean about it, just get it off my chest so I can stop living with the guilt and officially apologize to everybody. He told me not to. He told me that it would only hurt my career and what I did wasn't even that bad and that I should just not even think about it. I just shouldn't do it. I should have trusted my instincts but I didn't and therefore I didn't make the video. I didn't confess to it and I really wish I would have because people wouldn't think that I'm only remorseful because this became public. People would understand that I really did regret my decisions. So yeah, I'm not only sorry I got caught. I've been sorry for a very, very long time. So I'd like to now officially apologize. First and foremost, I want to apologize to any of the girls that I talk to and I ask to do that. I am very, very sorry. I shouldn't have asked you to do that. It was foolish of me and it was wrong. I shouldn't have done it. I'd also like to apologize to any fans or people that aren't fans that feel that they've been hurt because they feel like they've been lied to by me. I'm really sorry about all of this and I'm sorry if I've disappointed you. I really truly am. So there is no way to write my wrongs. There's no way to fix this. There's not a simple solution to say, okay, I'm forgiven. But I hope that at least some of you will possibly forgive me and if you don't forgive me, at least maybe give me a chance because I am so much better than the terrible decisions I made when I was desperate for attention. I'm better than that. I'm a different person. I've completely changed from all of that. I don't know how to show you guys that but I think with time you'll see. You'll see that I'm better now and I'm here to truly make a difference. So I'm moving forward. I'm moving forward with my music. I'm going to be getting back on social media now. I'm going to start making my goofy, funny videos for you guys because I know that some of you still like them and they still brighten your day. I'm moving forward. I know some of you won't let this go. Some of you will still feel the need to comment on every little thing that I post telling me to kill myself. If you want to do that, you can do that. But I'd recommend you to find something more positive to do with your time as opposed to tear me down. I'm already fighting a daily battle and you can choose to add to it. I'm not going to give up because of your words. So once again, I'm moving forward. And I'll see you guys soon. I'm truly sorry and thank you for your time. I really appreciate it."
002_SamNia," Hey guys, as you may have seen, my name has been associated with an Ashley Madison account. Website made for spouses who want to have an affair. I'm here to clarify some of this with you guys because I owe it to you. I did make the account. I made the account two years ago. This is an issue that is in our past. This was before I got onto YouTube. I brought this to my church at the time when I first started the church that I'm at now. This has been brought to my discipleship partner. This was brought to my wife's attention. She has forgiven me for this mistake that I made in opening the account. I've sought forgiveness to God and He's forgiven me. So I've been completely cleansed of this sin. And also I need to be clear that I've never met with a single person face to face through that website and that I never had an affair with anybody ever while I've been married with Nia. The account was open out of pure, fleshly desires and just simple curiosity. One of you are questioning my faith and me being a Christian and doing this. And I guess what some people don't understand is that we're all broken, even Christians. We come to God as broken people and He has sent Jesus on the cross to save us from those sins. And because this is in our past and this has already been completely resolved within our family and within my church, we won't be saying any more of this matter. I won't be talking to any media outlets. The only place you'll hear of this out of our mouth is here on this video, the only time. Now this is why we need a Savior. We're sinful by nature and we do stupid things like this. And this is what the Atomans all about, forgiveness and second chances. And I just want to add to guys, you know, I have forgiven Sam and I stand behind him. This is in our past and it's unfortunate that it's being dug up right now, but you know, our marriage is worth fighting for and it always will be. And I just want to encourage you guys who are dealing with any kind of situation like this within your marriage to just fight for what you have. Marriage is the real deal and it's been sealed and it's worth fighting for. It always will be. All right. And thank you guys so much for your support, the one standing by us and believing in us. And we'll see you guys tomorrow. God bless."
003_Keem,"What is up? No intro. I can't do the intro. It just feels stupid to do the fucking intro. Earlier today, I was so proud of Drom alert. I was so proud. People were giving me shit on Twitter. And I was just, I'm so proud of how successful my show has been becoming. But now as I sit here in front of you, I don't feel proud at all. I feel ashamed. I feel like a like a fucking dirt bag like an asshole like a fucking I feel horrible. Horrible is the best word for it. I feel horrible. I take pride in this show. I work hard on this show. I have people that work with me on this show. And earlier today, someone on my news team provided me with a story that I thought was about it, that I thought was correct, and it wasn't. It was wrong. And this isn't a little fuck up. This is a big fuck up. This is a serious big fuck up to the point where I just feel ashamed. I feel ashamed. I can't believe that we would fuck up like this. We reported a story that this Massachusetts man, John Phillips, had sex with a teen that he married an online game in RudeScape back in 2011. Okay. And then he caught on a jail and that he's streaming on Twitch again. Now the problem with this is that that's not John. That's a gentleman named Tony. And when we reported this video, a bunch of you went over and harassed this guy called him names, Pito, sex offender. You name it. This guy didn't fucking do anything. He didn't do anything wrong. And because of me, he was harassed for about two hours. I was streaming at the time on my own live stream. And someone came in and said, you know, you got it wrong. You got the story wrong. And I thought they were fucking with me. I thought they were fucking with me. I didn't. At first, I like blew it off. And then after about 10 minutes, I went into the Skype chat with my news team, went through questioned the guy that get me the news and asked him, how did you vet this? How did you confirm any of this? And he said him and another person on my news team sat there for hours looking at the faces and identified who was who and that it was the right guy. And I just I fucking lost it. My heart sunk into my stomach. The minute he gave me this explanation that they matched the faces, I realized that we just so fucked up. And I just I fucking died right there on my live stream. Like I immediately took down the video. And I immediately uploaded a video to Twitter telling everyone that we got this story wrong and that we've taken the video and that the guy that works for me is no longer working for me. And any damages that we've caused this guy, Tony, that we are going to take care of. I feel horrible. I mean, I know the responsible thing to do was to do what we did, right? I know the responsible thing is to acknowledge that we got this wrong. Take down the fucking video and try to take care of the guy and fix this financially or any way that he wants to make sure that we somehow fix our wrong doings. And I feel like we've done that because prior to any video being made about the situation prior to anyone talking about the situation, we came out first and acknowledged that we were wrong. I think, you know, we came out six hours ago as I'm making this and the videos that were made about me and how we fucked this up are like three hours. So we came out a full three hours before anyone made a video talking about this saying that we got it wrong, that we're going to take responsibility, that we've taken down the video, that we removed that guy off. And I'm not telling you this to somehow defend me or make me look better in any way. But I just want to point out that if you think that we don't take this serious, you're wrong. We take this very serious. I feel fucking horrible. I pride myself on getting you the facts. Like I pride myself on getting this right. And not only did I fail you, but I failed this stranger that I don't even know that sent a bunch of haters way. Like it just this innocent guy that had nothing to do with anything. And I just, I want to fix it. I want to apologize. I want to talk to this guy Tony and see if there's anything I can do. I want to. I don't ever want to fuck up like this again. I don't ever want to fail you like this again. I'm sorry. I'm sorry we got this wrong. I pride myself on being right. And I was not right this time. And Tony, if you're watching, we're going to make this right with you no matter what we have to do."
004_Fine," Hey everybody, this video is us wanting to explain some things about react world. The confusion and negative response over what this all is has been so overwhelming. And what we've realized is that we completely screwed up with how we originally talked about this. First and foremost, we're sorry for confusing people by using terminology like our react format. We were never trying to say that every video or someone reacts to something else is something we would try to control. When we referenced licensing the react format, we only meant our specific series, not the overall genre of reaction videos. We do not own the genre. And we're creators at heart and those who know us personally know how passionate we are about trying to help creators. And react world is meant to be an extension of that with us simply providing resources and tools to anyone who wants to go down this path of creating one of our series with direct support from us. So there's no way to go into all of the questions that people have about this. But we're going to answer some of the biggest ones that we've seen. Okay, so first is what exactly constitutes any of your series formats? And the simple answer is watch any of our series that is part of the react world license. And that is the exact format. It's not one or two elements. It's all of the elements of the show all used in the same style and way. We've been trying to find an analogy to explain this better and we know that this isn't the best. But if you wanted to start a fast food restaurant, you can start one on your own and possibly find huge success. But if you love Burger King and want to be part of that organization, if you join, you'd be able to get access to things like menu items and recipes and specific logos and promotional support. And these are two totally different routes. Same kind of thing here with react world. You can join and get all these assets and support. Or you can make your own reaction videos completely without us. It's up to you. Okay, so another question is have you applied for any trademarks? Yes, we have trademarks just like other companies that use trademarks to protect their properties. So for example, we have a YouTube channel, YouTube.com slash react. So we're trying to protect it and not run the risk of losing our channel name. Thanks to someone else getting the trademark. But just because we have or might get trademarks doesn't mean we're going to run around and start taking down videos. And the last thing we're going to talk about is if there has ever been a situation where we have to take down someone's video. Yes, and look, when you create series and products, sometimes there is specific situations where your content is being infringed. Like if someone freeboots a video on Facebook or in very rare cases, if someone produces a beat by beat version of your exact series, which has happened to us. Put again with this one and all of these, it's very, very complex. And we also know that there's so many more questions that you guys have and we want to do our best to answer as many of them as possible. So we've set up an email that we will be personally checking if you want more clarification. So please write us at askthefimbruesatgmail.com. For our viewers who are not really part of this conversation and just here to watch our videos, thanks for sticking with us through this. And for everyone else, we want to continue the conversation. But either way, we just wanted to thank everyone for hearing us out."
005_Pepper,"Okay, firstly I don't really know how to start this video and we want to review of always kind of being awkward when I'm sitting one-on-one with a camera, I don't really like it, it's not very comfortable, but I'm going to do this without any cuts and I'm going to try and talk to you as if I was talking to one of my friends or someone I know because I want to be completely honest with you now and get everything off my chest and tell you everything and make sure what I'm saying to you is 100% from my heart, it's not active and it's not, you know, as if I'm not talking to a camera, as if I'm talking to you, so sorry if I'm a little bit all over the place, I just want to make sure I get everything out there. And as you can see over the last few days I've kind of disappeared from social media and I've never really been at a point in my life where I've just wanted to completely give up and stop doing something like I love and something that, you know, my job, you know, it's my life, YouTube's my life as much as Halloween, that sounds, you choose my life and I've never really been at that point and I shut down all my network side, took off all my videos and I was ready to give up. But I thought, wow, I might as I'll talk to you guys first and tell you everything and tell you everything from the beginning and tell you how I've got to where I am now and how I've got in a situation where I ended up shutting down all my stuff and explain it to you and be honest with you for once, like honestly sit down and talk to you and be real and be honest and be 100% myself because that's not what I've been. I started YouTube like six years ago and I was like, I was like, I've always made pranks since day one. Even before YouTube I was very much that kind of person and I was like mischievous, I like making people laugh, I was always like the class clown in school and I've always, you know, enjoyed doing that. When I started YouTube I started doing pranks and there was like three channels that made pranks. There was me, there was like prank versus prank and there was Ed Bassmaster, really they were the only kind of known prank channels out there and I did silly pranks, I just did stuff to make people laugh, I did stuff to make people smile and just really silly, harmless, dumb stuff and it was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it and the people who are involved in the videos they're always laughing, people would laugh watching them and there's no problem. Before I go any further I want to say at the beginning, this, I'm not telling you just about any sympathy or whatever, I'm in the situation because of me, this is completely my fault, no one else has thought this is not for sympathy, this is nothing for us. I just want to tell you everything, honestly, no BS, none of that, this is me to you, whatever happens from here on, whatever it doesn't matter, this is just for me to you. I was one of the first pranks, pranks those, prank channels, whatever and then all these other prank channels, they started coming out and they'd be doing more and more and more crazy stuff and obviously I've watched these videos because I come from doing pranks, I'd be like there's no way they could be doing that, like you can't do that, like if you do that you're going to get in trouble and that's when I worked out, even back to TV I used to watch as a kid, like all this stuff is fake, like we believe it all but it's really fake and all it was about was the end goal, you know, when someone watches it, whether they laugh, whether they are angry, it was all to do with the reaction of the person who's watching it more than the reaction of the person's being pranked. So I worked out, oh okay I can do these pranks that these other channels are doing and I can just fake them, I can just like make fake videos because it's like any other industry like anything, music, art, anything, movies, everything moves with a trend and when something happens, like clothes for example, you don't wear clothes that are in season, like you don't wear clothes that were in fashion like three years ago, you wear current things and that's the same with my YouTube channel, I wanted to keep it current, I wanted to obviously get views, I wanted to get money, like that's what my, you know, it's my job, I make videos so I can live, I want to keep my channel active, I want to keep it relevant and any big YouTube business watching this, you know how you constantly have that fear in the back of your head that when am I going to go and relevant, when, when is, you know, this video didn't do as well as this one, this one didn't do as it's always in your head and you always think that, so I start making fake videos and I don't like them and you know, some are good, some are like whatever and then this whole like picking up gals face came along and I was like okay, like I can do that, I can make videos doing that, I did that and what I wasn't thinking this whole time is if I have to fake a video, that means that it's too crazy for me to actually do for real, if, yeah, if, if, you know, if you can't do that in real life and you can't do it as a real prank, then you shouldn't be doing that as a fake prank because I know, oh, I'm not, you know, I would never kidnap someone, I would never do this, I would never do that, I know that, I know who I am as a person, but the viewers, you guys and people who don't normally watch me are watching that and I see me and I think who's this douche, why is he doing all this stupid stuff and that's right, like, I was making myself look like a douche to everyone and no wonder people hate me like I've been an idiot, like I've been stupid, start from when it first, like all the kind of hatred towards me and when I first made myself look like a massive douche, was when I did the fake, fake ass pinch prank where I like made a fake arm and then I went up to Gowls and I pinched our butts, of course I've known real life that I can't do that, that's why I've baked it and I asked everyone before I did it, hey, I'm doing this video, I'm gonna come up to you, I'm gonna ask you for directions, I'm gonna pinch your butt with my hand, I've got hidden here, I've shown, I'd explain my YouTube channel and I explain everything and I know and they know and I know I'm from that, you know, that video was, you know, her or upset from it but when I put that video up, of course people like I'm stupid, I was stupid and I'm an idiot but people are causing me to think I'm a douche because I'm acting like a fucking douche, like I'm acting like an idiot, I'm pinching random gals butts in the street without asking them, and I'd ask them like okay I want you to react like this, I want you to be like super shocked and jump back, like I, all I was thinking was like oh this video will be really like people will laugh, it's funny but I'm not thinking oh no like I'm seeing you pinching the gals butt and think who's this creep and then so then I made that video, I put that up and of course I got a ton of hay and I was like I never had that, starting from like the very beginning, I kind of got slung into YouTube, like I chose again no sympathy, nothing, I got into YouTube really young and I'm not come from like a famous background, like I don't have parents who are like in the industry or you know I'm not had kind of management or people who are said like this is how you do this is how you do that like I get a no sympathy, I've done everything myself and I didn't know how to handle that hay and I didn't know how to handle that whole scenario and my first like instinct, I've been making fake videos and like I've been faking it my whole online persona like this is not me, I've been faking everything, why don't I just try and twist this into something else which was number one the stupidest thing I could have done, I should have just came out and said hey guys I'm an idiot, I fake this video, I want to I want to make content that gets views and I've been trying to follow the trends and I just messed up and I'm an idiot and I should have done what I'm doing now but instead I said oh like oh I'm doing this social experiment like I am, you guys know it's bullshit and I made a bullshit story and I made a bullshit video and it just made my situation worse because then everyone wanted to attack me even more and then stories were coming out like people were saying like sounds done there sounds done that like to the point that people were saying that I raped them and like I feel just so stupid even talking to you about this right now and half the reason why I haven't taught you like my current girlfriend I've been with her like a year and a half now it took me like four months to even build up the culture torture about this like oh by the way like people lying think I'm a rapist like who wants to say that that's like messed up like just because of a stupid video I made which was stupid and again it's my own fault but people have come out and said like complete bullshit about me and like of course I'm not a rapist I wouldn't be seeing here right now today and I don't want to say that I don't want to have to see on camera and be like oh hi guys like I'm not a rapist like that's messed up like who wants to say that I want to say that to my girlfriend and like it's just a shit situation to be in I grew on myself again but to an extent you don't want people just making up lies about you and and all of that so after like that whole scenario I was just like I'm never felt that way before in my whole entire life like I just lied on the floor and you know my friends who are around at the time they know the state I was in I just lied down I just couldn't do anything I couldn't move I couldn't talk I couldn't think what to do I was lying on the floor and I was just like I was obviously destroyed I thought my life was over like you like you know how it is there's Google there's everything like I was scared like oh whenever I meet new people they're gonna Google me this is what they're gonna think for me I like I'm but of course I brutal on myself I put in the image forwards of me not like the real me and so then I so then I kind of like pulled my shit together I thought like I can't give up like I've never given up in anything my whole entire life like I've lived on my own since I was 16 I've worked my whole entire life like I've never given up no matter what situation I've been putting on never given up and I always find a way around it so I started making new videos I started making like new content that was like a little you know just silly back to the beginning like completely real silly pranks just fun stuff and of course everyone hated me from that video and what I've been doing and how I presented myself so people weren't obviously like oh now sounds back to normal like that's just give you know like of course people aren't gonna be like that and so no one really really liked the videos and really watched them and my channel just kind of stayed hitting like no views and it's again it's my job like I don't do anything chaos I just do YouTube so I'm obviously worrying about my rent I'm worrying about all of this stuff and I'm still making videos making videos and then it gets to a point where I'm like okay well I've made fake videos before and they've done well and they've got like decent views why don't I why don't I make another you know another video and that brings me onto making the best friend killing prank and you know exactly what I'm gonna say now of course it was fake um I spoke with Sam and Kobe about doing the video and I said I want to do something you know I want to do so big we're gonna do a video together I have this idea I want to do this like I know it's crazy and I mean potentially a few people are gonna be a bit mad about it but I think it'll go really viral a lot of views and again like I push towards the side like oh people that'll be mad at this like you can't kidnap your friends you can't kill your friend like I push that all to one side and instead of thinking then okay if people aren't gonna like it why would I want to put that out there if people are gonna be even the smallest bit mad at me why would I want people thinking that of me that's not who I am so again I put the video up and I got a huge backlash again because I'm putting forward to the wrong image of myself I'm putting forward like a character that I've created that who doesn't give a fuck who will just make crazy videos who will kidnap his friend who will grab get sorry my battery died um as I was saying uh I put the video in I put across an image of myself that I didn't want people to see but I'm not thinking that I'm thinking about the views and I'm thinking about oh I'm gonna you know I'm gonna be able to bring my channel back and it's stupid all of this was my whole fault process was stupid I was an idiot I put across this image and there's all these channels making videos about me and people saying stuff about me and I'm watching on my well yeah like I guess like that's who I put that's who I've made people think and I've fallen into a category and I can even play that character or I can give up that was my fault process and I never wanted to give up and I never wanted to sit here and had to make this video like I this whole time it's like you have pride and everyone has pride and I'm gonna be real with you because that's what I'm trying to do no one wants to admit that wrong no one wants to like ask for someone's forgiveness or ask for a second chance or anything like that it's just that's normal human pride and I the reason why I haven't made this video up until now is because I don't want to talk about these things like I pushed into the side like I push I'm the type of person that will just take a problem I'll be like okay it doesn't have to be a problem I push it to the side and I'll move on and and sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't it doesn't work with this because you guys don't know my friends know who I am my friends know oh then videos of vague then videos like they know that but you guys don't know that you guys that's who you think I am and I can't go on making videos even if I was to change my content I can't go on making videos unless I made this video for you guys and to tell you like yo this is me this is who I am and I've messed up and I'm an idiot and I know why you think what you think of me and I know why you think I'm an idiot and I know why you think I'm a douche because I've been acting like one I've been acting like a complete idiot online and that's the image I put across to you and it's completely understandable that that's why you think of me what you think of me so I've been thinking these last few days and I know what I want to do and I know what's right to do and I want to ask you guys again like don't need to feel sorry for me but I feel like stupid happened to ask this but I want a second chance like I'm really asking you guys like please give me a second chance and I'll prove to you that I can make content that that represents me as a person that inspires that makes I would like to avenge you I like to travel I like to meet new people I like to do really cool things and I want to show you guys I want to make like awesome vlogs of my life and I want to make videos where I

006_Leafy,Hey what's up guys it's Leafy and as many of you guys know this is gonna be a apology video for everything that has happened recently and also me explaining basically what exactly happens because I mean shit a lot of people don't even know exactly what happened yet So first off before I say anything I just want to say guys I fucked up I know I fucked up I'm not gonna sit here and try to redirect the blame I'm not gonna sit here and make excuses and I'm willing to admit that I am in the wrong here and I'm sorry and I would also like to thank everybody that is supporting me through this whole thing you know without the people that supporting me through this whole thing there's no way I would have been able to go through this and you know a lot of YouTube content creators always talk about how much they appreciate their fans and their audience but I feel like a lot of these guys will never understand the full extent of it until well they get some people that want their blood and I can't even express how much I want to say thank you to everybody that is supporting me through this entire thing I mean fuck like this has been one of the worst things has happened to me in the 20 years I've been alive and just to see so many people actually defend me in this I just can't thank you guys enough but regardless I know I'm in the wrong here and I would like to explain some of my reasoning and not giving me excuses what exactly happened because just as I said a lot of people don't actually know what happened yet so a few weeks ago I found a video on a subreddit called Slashar Cringe and the video was about this guy that was walking around a parking lot in a shopping market someone was packing their groceries into their car and they accidentally left their eggs on top of the car and he ran over and saved this lady's eggs after he saved this lady's eggs he pulled out his phone and he started doing a little interview with the lady and during the interview the guy asked her a few questions and the lady looks pretty uncomfortable with being recorded but I saw this a while back on the subreddit Slashar Cringe and I thought about making a video on it but I never ended up getting to it and again I'm not trying to make any excuses I'm just trying to give the full side of the story but a few days ago I was hanging out with one of my friends and we were watching Tosh.0 on YouTube and we saw Tosh.0 making a video about the same guy on the subreddit the same guy on the parking lot and Tosh was fairly harsh with the video now after seeing the Tosh video I looked him up on YouTube and ended up finding his YouTube channel and in his YouTube banner he had as seen on MTV and Comedy Central basically talking about Tosh.0 but after seeing that I didn't think the video would have gave such a negative response so I ended up making a video about the Walmart parking video now after making this video apparently a lot of my fans went over to his YouTube channel and started giving him death threats and started harassing him and whatnot and after that a few people come to me and tell me that apparently he could actually be autistic and at this point in time I knew I fucked up I know completely that I should have done more research involving this whole thing and with that I'm sorry and I know I fucked up now since the video this YouTuber has completely returned and uploaded four different videos since the video of him quitting I've also got a fair bit of death threats which are pretty understandable at this point in time but regardless I would like to say sorry to everybody I offended all my fans I disappointed and of course Tommy but overall guys I know I made a mistake I know I fucked up and at this point in time the only thing I can really do is to keep moving forward and move past this but thank you so so much to everybody that is supporting me through this without you guys I would not have been able to go through this and of course thank you guys for your time
007_Toby, A person I dated a few years ago has just made some extremely serious false accusations about me. I want to be crystal clear. I have never done anything without her consent. I've never tried to trick her into anything. I read her Tumblr post and I was shocked and I was hurt. These allegations are absolutely false. I just wanted to address it. That's all.
008_Tmar,"Cooper, I have no idea how I'm gonna record this video, dude. Alright guys, so I'm gonna try to make this as short and sweet as possible. I don't want to take up too much of your time, but first and foremost, I do want to say that I love you guys. You guys seriously mean the world to me. You have the past six years that I've been on YouTube and you honestly have changed my life. Every single day I get to wake up and chase my dreams and follow my passions and that's all been made possible by you guys. So thank you guys for everything that you've done for me and all the opportunities and memories that you've allowed me to create. Now my connection to CSGO Lotto has been a matter of public record since the company was first organized in December of 2015. However, I do feel like I owe you guys an apology. I am sorry to each and every one of you who felt like that was not made clear enough to you. And I truly honestly hope that you guys give me an opportunity to earn your trust back. Please also know that I am committed to making sure that my YouTube channel as well as all of my other businesses are in compliance with the law. This is why I do not condone miners under the age of 18 to use CSGO Lotto. This is and always has been a clearly stated policy available both in the terms of service as well as the initial sign-up page on the website. I've seen a lot of people focusing on the under the age of 13 section of our privacy policy. All this section states is that we do not knowingly record information of children under the age of 13 years old in compliance with the COP Act. This has nothing to do with and does not mean that we condone miners under the age of 18 to play on the site. Also and this is very important to me, I believe that every game offered on CSGO Lotto has been legitimate and I am committed to making sure that that remains true. Again, you guys seriously mean the world to me. Like you've changed my life in so many ways I'll never be able to thank you for what you all have done. Thank you guys so much for all the support of the years and I'm just so grateful for each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart. So thank you guys for watching. I truly do appreciate it. I look forward to getting back to my regularly scheduled content and I hope to see you guys there. Thanks guys."
009_Rice,"Hey guys, what's up? I just woke up and um, I just want to say I took the biggest L in the history of L's like literally I messed up really bad And I just want to make this video to say sorry to everyone that I offended sorry to all the people that I let down and sorry to all the rate victims out there Um, I couldn't easily waited a week for this or waited tomorrow to have someone write me up something where I can say and make it perfect because this apology won't be perfect I'm gonna leave out some stuff But at least it's genuine right and it's like people Have been hating on me for like the past hour. I've been reading it over and it sucks because like There's like you guys don't even know like the full truth, right? So before you guys hate on me everything else so before you comment just watch this whole entire video and then you know Have your opinions on it But yeah, if you guys are like right now what the hell are you even talking about? If you guys don't know what happened basically, there's this youtuber that hates my guts, right? He hates me a lot his name is Onision. He's made multiple videos just attacking me Calling me out and none of them seem to work because you know, I don't know what he's been hating on me And so nothing seemed to work So today randomly is like all right, you know what? Let's find a clip of Rice Gum from a while ago before he blew up on YouTube and let's show people that clip You know and let's take you out of context and you know cut out all the good parts and let's just make him look as bad as possible So that's exactly what you did. He posted this I hate some people because they do stuff like this I told this dude know I don't want it and then like I was like drunk and then Yeah, and so that's why I don't really count that But why he raped you? Yeah, I mean Shoulder no, I didn't because like I he just has a lot of family members that are like That were like I got bullied like in high school like I don't know you got raped Yeah, bro, and this dude he raped like Hello people No, nobody did it feel good though. No, I didn't listen rice gum. I know you struggle to be socially aware, which is But yeah guys as you guys can see I am probably one of the biggest douchebags ever I literally just left at her and once again I think back and I'm like why did I do that? But once again, I am sorry just kind of funny because the person reporting this and bringing this to the public His name is O'Neal Cyan. He's pretty big on YouTube to Miller whatever. That's why it's kind of making a buzz But he reported on it and in the video he was like preaching about how rape is super serious and And super important and should not be joked around about you know rape is serious Which I totally agree rape I mean think about like rape is when you force someone What like you're literally just and that's so fucked up and I'm just thinking like why I laugh about that But only sounds over here, you know preaching it and I totally agree with him But like he's such a hypocrite because on his Twitter He's always making jokes about rape like like I'm not sure if he knows where I can search up his old tweets But this dude's a hypocrite but I'm not here to like plant fingers at people Cuz the point of the video like the objective of the video is to make you guys know that I'm sorry not to know Throw him under the bus or anything, but yeah, I'm sorry Just kind of ironic how he's the one exposing me when he jokes about rape all the time But yeah, I'm gonna run you guys through everything right now as easy and as fast as I can okay So before I blew up on YouTube I used to do this thing where I live stream right I sit there I play games live and then I tell stories I answer questions There's people watching and typing in the chat so I can interact with but this is what a live stream is right I do this pretty often back then I still do a live stream quite a bit now But yeah, I would sit there play games and answer questions and you know just like any other live stream But occasionally my viewers which is link me you know a random girl on Instagram or some Twitter And then I would just hit him up like hey you want to come on my live stream It's pretty funny cuz I would call them and we would just talk about just the random stuff So then I called this girl a lot. I was streaming and she seemed really nice And this actually wasn't our first time talking we've talked before but yeah I'm over here playing games and we're just having a conversation and we're talking about like just normal stuff wait Are you in college? Yeah? What college? Portland state Dem is lit It's kind of late. It's not it's not as lit as I would like it to be though I'm gonna like party and then out of nowhere she says okay, and I'm gonna say and basically I don't know I got great kind of like I told this dude know I don't want it and then like I was like drunk and then Yeah, and so that's why I don't really count that Why he raped you? Yeah, I mean Shoulder no, I didn't because like I he just has a lot of family members that are like That were like I got bullied like in high school like I don't know you got raped yeah, bro And this dude he raped like Helipie No, I'm not what did it feel good though? No, I didn't As you guys can see by my face. I was really just caught off guard and like had no idea what was going on Like I was like did she really just say that in front of thousands of people because you know usually on my life She's people don't talk about that personal or like that personal type of stuff So I was like oh, so I didn't know how to respond. I didn't know what to do there So I mean, I guess I was just in a weird spot and that probably explains why I said something stupid because I just didn't know what to say I was just trying to not make it silent. I'm assuming I don't know And another thing that Onisa did that was kind of shady because so here's the clip that Onisa showed See how you like cuts off the top of it so basically who's trying to hide the chat the chat so so here's the original clip Right see how the chat is on the top right so those are everyone that's talking right and and see how the chat Reacted to when she said it so it's pretty fast So everyone's like WTF and like what's going on and stuff and like it takes a while for the chat to process Since it's like all live and there's the video processing so it takes like 20 seconds for the chat to actually pop up on screen But this was their reaction as soon as they heard the word rape So everyone started freaking out because it was so random and I started freaking out I don't know what to say because it once again, it is live So everything I said is like save there. I can't like think about what to say. It's literally like a regular conversation live so I'm like I'm a crack a joke and it was the worst time they crack a joke and I probably should have said what I said I regret it and I will regret it for like the next 10 years on be like why did I say that and I'm sorry I'm really sorry the weird thing is after I made that joke or that rude remark, you know towards her situation We kept talking like another hour of conversation happened like as if nothing happened like she wasn't affected at all by what I said It was a joke. She understands that it was a joke and she just moved on and like the next day we talked I've texted her occasionally recently and so we're like, you know cool and stuff So it's like so you know in my head I'm like I didn't do anything wrong and now everyone's pointing out you know and as I rewatch the clip I'm like okay, I clearly messed up. I'm I'm so sorry because like looking back now that what I said was really immature and really not fun Like it wasn't funny at all like why make an offensive joke if it's not been funny at all like what I said was even funny, right? So yeah, I woke up today I saw the video exposing me and the first thing in my head. I was even like I'm gonna make a video defending myself The first thing I did was I called her Yeah Yes Oh my gosh, yeah Yeah, I just Is it on yeah, all right, what's up? All right, so probably I confused or whatever but Are you remember like it was like a while ago actually, but it was like Are you told so I was like streaming and then I called you whatever and then you told me like that story about how like you got raped or whatever Oh, yeah, yeah, I remember Yeah, so it's like I think like after you told me a story like I started laughing or you know, I said something pretty like pretty rude or whatever and then I Is wanting to call you and say sorry, you know, I didn't mean to say that. I probably shouldn't have said what I said It should have been more mature about it Yeah, I mean, I don't really remember you saying anything like that like better remember that was like, you know bad really But no, what am I said like I don't know I said something like I did it feel good or something and just It really Oh, it's okay. I mean, I'm not even really tripping. I knew you're joking around like the entire time like he wasn't really like Like that's just in your nature, you know Hey, there's are gonna be like race to him You didn't mean the apology to her and you sounded so fake and why were you smiling through the whole thing Imagine calling someone and asking them about something from a year ago that you're like not proud of like Connor and be like Hey, you remember that one time I roasted you about being right, you know, it's it like it was kind of awkward It was really early too, so but one last time I am sorry to anyone that was affected by this or anyone that was offended or felt disrespected This joke wasn't funny at all rape is not a joke rape should be taken seriously and I don't know why I thought this was a good idea So I am so sorry and once again haters are gonna hate they're gonna after watching this whole entire video They'll still find a way to hate me, but like what more can I do like this was in the past I can't go back in time and you know change it, but this is the best I can do I can say sorry to you guys I can say sorry to the girl and I can just learn from this and never do it again Which will never happen again because I mean I'm not that stupid come on, but okay Thank you for hearing me out now you can comment whatever you want to comment race come you fucking suck whatever Um just let me know though do not leave this video without commenting I make sure you say something like rice man. I lost some respect, but I mean at least you're sorry or rice man I watch all your vids, but this is an all-time low. I'm done watching you. I don't know anything you want I just want to know where your head's at you guys kind of know where my head's at I am obviously sorry. I said sorry to the girl and you guys. I don't know what else I can do Once again if there's something else I can do to make this situation better let me know I may be overreacting. I may not be, but I am really sorry But yeah, thank you for making it to the end I've been seeing tweets all day like oh, I'm done with this kid unsubscribe But I feel like everyone should see this video, you know, both side of the story So if you guys can if you see anyone talking that shit Lake them this video or you know, make sure they know the truth and make sure they know that I'm actually sorry So yeah, that's it new video tomorrow on my main channel I was supposed to post it today But this happened so it's postponed till tomorrow. Thank you again for the support And I love you guys and have a great day"
010_Louis,"Hey guys, I'm making a video today to respond to the massive amount of criticism I've had over my North Korea vlogs. I don't know if you've seen but I'm all over the press with accusations that I'm being paid by the North Korean government as a tool for propaganda and although that makes great headlines that there's no truth in that whatsoever, I'm not being paid by the North Korean government and actually I want to make a statement now, I do not agree with the North Korean ideologies but I do care for and love the people there. For those of you that are new to my channel, my name's Louis, I travel the world having fun adventures and I share those with my audience, I've been to developed countries, developing countries with a range of political problems and social justice issues to my favourite cities Cape Town and Rio have the biggest wealth disparity in the world but I am looking for the beautiful positive things, I want to connect with local people, learn about the culture and the country. I am not an investigative journalist, I don't really do political commentary and there are other places on the internet you can go to find those kind of things. So this trip to North Korea as many of my trips I went on as a tourist and we went on an organised tour so the same kind of tour anyone going there as a tourist would experience and as much as we can be skeptical about how much was real and how much was staged that is what I experienced and I can only share with you guys what I experienced so that's what I did on my videos. The assumption I made which may have been wrong with me was that people watching my North Korea vlogs would have already had a broader perspective on North Korea, they would have seen documentaries, they would have seen news articles as I have and I want to reassure you that I do know what's going on out there and not being naive to it all and maybe I should have at the beginning of each vlog encourage people to go and do their own research and find out all that they can about North Korea. So I want to explain how I ended up going on the trip now. My friend Lane posted on Facebook that he was going or wanted to go so I contacted him and found out that he was going with an organisation that were running their third annual surf school so I asked if I could join the team and come along. So the guy organising these trips has been visiting North Korea for 17 years doing humanitarian relief work, he doesn't work for the government but he has been building a relationship with the government and with the people there and I don't want to jeopardise any of the work that he's done with the content I've been creating. So Philip DeFranco he's a popular youtuber and he made a video about this unfolding drama, he criticised me with an analogy about being taken on a tour around a big mansion knowing that there's rooms with murder and torture going on in them but only being shown to the rooms like the nice swimming pool and the kitchen and the games room and then leaving that mansion just talking about those things. My only question to that is what about the people in the house that are in those rooms, in the nicer rooms? I think the only way to make a difference is to connect to those people and show them love and maybe that will impact the entire household. So if that means surfing or going on these tours then I'm really keen to do that and I'm the only thing that's sad is that I can't show you all of the relationships that I've built and the conversations I've had off camera which I think is something I always struggle with with my vlogs. In Pyongyang the capital we went to a water park and we were surfing in the wave pool there and there was this one moment where I looked around and there were eight different nations represented. There was people from Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, the US, the UK, North Korea, Russia, I think there's another one Finland. The Russian guy was actually just at the water park and he was from the embassy, the Russian embassy and one of the North Korean tour guides turned to us and said surfing brings peace and I think that was a very strong message and I think it really does. I really think it, you know, as you've seen with the Olympics a lot of sporting activities. I don't know if you saw the selfie of the North and South Korean gymnasts with a peace sign that I'll show you here. Like for me those things break down barriers and I think that was the whole purpose of us being able to connect with people out there. So I'll leave you with this final thought. A North Korean business specialist Felix Apt said, if you have no presence in the country you cannot influence anything for the better and I think the future of our relationship, like our the international community's relationship with North Korea is fully dependent on how well we know them and the intention of this trip was to go out and get to know them better and I'm happy to say I made some friends out there and I'm really looking forward to going out to visit them again."
011_JonTron," Well, this certainly has been an interesting week. So recently as you may have heard I had a public debate about some contentious topics relevant to the day, I blew up in the media and they wrote some, how you say, charitable articles on me. So I feel like I need to come out and say something. Sting Silent doesn't really feel right, so I'm just going to address this here and now. I understand that I wasn't prepared for a debate of this sort, with these kinds of sensitive topics at hand adequately. You know, I was a bit all over the place and I said a lot of stuff that could be misconstrued in all sorts of ways. Things are being extracted from this that I know I don't think. I was in there under a lot of pressure that I'm not used to being under and as it became clear, I suck at debate. So now every half hazard offhand remark I made in the heat of the moment is being dissected and speculated on. So I like to clarify, I was trying to speak to the increasing tribalization of our culture. These days were taught to think inexplicitly racial or ethnic categories or in terms of gender or sexual orientation and I think this in itself plays a big hand in what's gotten our country to the volatile state that it's in. The simple point I was trying to make is that it's hypocritical for those who see everything in terms of race to suddenly turn around and object when white people speak up in what they believe are the best interests of their race. And it's also hypocritical to keep saying you want to have an honest conversation about race. If you don't actually want to have an honest conversation about race and anytime someone brings up an uncomfortable statistic, you freak out and burn things down or something. And I mean you can see this in all the countless media articles that get pumped out every day from the highest level saying for instance, you can't be racist against white people or it's a good thing whites are going to become a minority. Or you see it on TV when someone as mainstream as Samantha B says, white people ruined America for voting Trump. It's pretty clear who ruined America. White people. I suppose you could guess the reaction of Samantha B said black people ruined America for voting overwhelmingly for Barack Obama, which they did both times. I'm not saying that's true, but the same standard applies. The point I was trying to make, albeit indelicately, is that you can't keep banging the racial category drum and then be surprised and shocked when people think in racial categories. And just for the sake of total clarity, I do completely understand that historically the African-American community has had a raw deal in this country. Discrimination certainly exists, but I do believe it goes always. I'm not naive to the fact that we, as a country, have had a terrible history of dealing with race. I mean of course, from slavery to Jim Crow to even the Irish, but the point is that this kind of discrimination is universally wrong. And I feel like for some reason we're regressing on this front. Pointing on a race and saying, all of this race is blank is racist. And I have to be honest, I don't see many people losing their jobs over this kind of garbage. And I'd like to make it clear, I have no problem with immigration when it's handled correctly. I should have made it clear I was mostly speaking to mass immigration. I am literally a child of two immigrants. It would be pretty heinous of me to say that immigration is impossible because it's not. You know, I brought all this stuff up off-hand in a random Twitch stream late at night. So I understand why people looking at this think I'm some sort of explicit ethno nationalist, but I'm not. I genuinely believe this country would be better off if we dropped the hyphens and just all referred to each other as fellow Americans. And for a number of years now, it's been disheartening to me to see this strange road we've been headed down. I really don't understand it. And you know, some of these topics have really been weighing on me, so I felt compelled to respond in some way, perhaps against my better judgment. I know people don't expect these kinds of things from me. So in summary, you know, I'm sorry if this has come out of left field for some of you. I hope this has cleared up at least a little bit. If you were curious, what was going on. You know, any of the things in the stream that could be considered weird sounding or off-putting, I probably agree with you that they were. So I hope you don't read too much into it. That said, I genuinely hope people keep debating, keep talking to each other and keep learning. Honest, civil discourse without witch hunts is the only way we're getting out of this mess. I prefer to take a step back now, return to doing comedy. It's what I do better anyway. Thank you sincerely to all of you who've supported me through this ride. I really appreciate it. If you'd like to catch up on my new videos, you know what to find me."
012_EthanH3,"Earlier today we made a video exploring the possibility that the screenshots the wall street journal was publishing and sending to brands were fake and we base this on a screenshot of analytics of the dude who made the video and concluded that because there were no earnings on that graph the pictures had to be fake. After posting the video we realized that there may actually be a possibility that the video itself was claimed and that's why the revenue wasn't showing up on his graph. Upon further investigation we realized that that video was actually claimed which threw too much doubt into our theory and we felt it was our responsibility to make a correction and tell you guys of that mistake and to take down the video. When I first saw the creator of this video it was in a comment section where he had said that the picture was photoshopped and I had assumed that he would tell me if the video was claimed and it hadn't even occurred to me to ask him that question which I naively made that mistake. I find it extremely interesting by the way that in Wall Street Journal's reporting they never mentioned that the video itself was claimed. Instead they said that racist hateful people were making money on YouTube but the fact is this guy wasn't making money was the person who claimed his video. Interestingly we talked to the network that claimed the video and we were able to actually see how much money this video made. In 160,000 views the video itself made $12 and if you don't know anything about how YouTube videos make money that is astronomically low. So in 160,000 you would expect it to make up to $300 all it made was 12. The reason that this is so suspicious is that according to the Wall Street Journal they and the span of just 30 views found three of the most premium high paying ad rolls on all of YouTube including Starbucks, Toyota and Coca Cola. This honestly doesn't make any sense and doesn't add up at all. How does a video with 160,000 views make only $12 with three of the most premium high paying ads on YouTube playing over the span of 30 views? It doesn't add up at all. In the future we need to be more thorough. It's definitely ironic that I accused the Wall Street Journal of not being thorough but in the same video even dropped that you know this one's real Ethan. That that crushed my heart because you know I can never use that meme again. Anyway guys I appreciate you and we'll be seeing you next time. Thanks guys."
013_DadO,"Hello, Team DO5. This is going to be a bit of a different video than we usually do. This has been the absolute worst week of our life and we realize that we have made some terrible parenting decisions and we just want to make things right. During this week we've had a lot of time to stand back to jump out of character and to see what we've done and to see how we've come across and I understand how everyone feels. I acknowledge and I respect how everyone feels about this and I do agree that we put things on the Internet that should not be there. We did things that we should not do. And as a mother over the last week, looking back at the videos and just thinking about things, if I didn't know the people and I saw some of those things, I would be thinking the same thing. I would be like, oh my god, those poor children. Once people started watching us and the kids got excited about it and they would try to see how many views they could get and we feel like we went from something that wasn't so bad and then we just kept going more and more for the shock factor versus reality and to see what could get more views. They kind of feel like some of it's their fault and it's not their fault. It's not. It's where the parents and we should have made better decisions. We could give them a whole lot more than we could give them before and we just felt like we were doing the best thing that we could for them. We are now in family counseling because we need it not only to get through the media stuff but we need it to come back together and have everybody, even the kids, to understand what we did wrong in all this. We just want to give our kids back to some type of normalcy. We just want them to be able to go back to school and just live their lives. I just wanted to take care of everybody. We just wanted you guys, we wanted them to be happy. We just wanted our kids to be happy and we went about it the wrong way. We're focused on making sure that our kids don't have to deal with so much backlash from our bad decisions and we realize now what kind of a situation we put them in. We're just really sorry to them."
014_Jake,"I hate making these videos but it's like so necessary and again like these daily vlogs are my life and how I feel and I feel bad. BAM! Huh? Okay guys, my friend Chan so you guys know one of his worst fears in life is getting easy busted for wearing fake Yeezy's. So there's this account on Instagram called YeezyBuster that posts people who wear fake Yeezy's and they expose people. Chan's has like all real Yeezy's but this is still like a huge fear of his and he's sleeping right now. So I got these hella fake like look how fake these are. I got these hella fake Yeezy's and I'm gonna set them next to him while he's sleeping. Take a picture with him and then send it to my friend at YeezyBuster and they're gonna post it and we're gonna see Chan's reaction. I think I think he's gonna freak out. Ooh. Chan's. Smile. Not bro. Nothing. You good bro? Does he's going on bro? How did he got what I needed? Just take these. No. No. It's not cool. It's not cool. What's making you do? Let's do it to Tony. Where is he?

And somehow my dad finesses his way into getting fitted for this another outfit. Now we're going to be wearing the same exact thing. My publicist's brooks here. That's my publicist. That's not your publicist. That's mine. I just start talking to him. He's like, you want to get some coin? I'm like, sure. Let's do it. I don't think that's how the conversation went. I think you finessed your way into it. Do you want to do some more business? Let's do more business. But in the meantime, I see a set of spinny doors. Oh boy. Let's go. Woo! Woo! Woo! We're getting yelled at. You guys see that? That was lit, right? Woo! Oh, I'm not recording. Is it on the camera? That's on me on camera? Yeah. Two hours later. Just left. Another meeting. You guys today is very different. You're seeing a business side of Jake. We got a lot going on. Life's a lot better than you. I'm not recording. Is it on the camera? That's on me on camera? Yeah. Two hours later. It's not going on. Life's moving fast. This is what happens, guys. We still got a couple of meetings more to go. The meeting we just had with merch in opportunities for toys, shoes, socks. Oh! Go get one more. You are recording, right? I don't know. Maybe I was supposed to tell anybody about that. Whoa, why do we just did? Let's go do some more stuff. Just got home from my last meeting. It's like 12.30. You got a grand Jake. Probably as we all here fam doing it. It's every day, bro. Like, for real. Like, if you want things in life bad enough, you got to go get it. Dear YouTube. I hate making these videos, but it's like so necessary. And again, like these daily vlogs are my life. And how I feel. And I feel bad. I feel a lot of regret. I feel I haven't been myself the past week. And it's not okay. So the first thing I want to say is, I'm sorry for not being myself. I'm sorry for a lot of things. But the first thing I'll say is like over the past couple of years my life, it's been like a whirlwind of excitement. And I've had to adapt to it. And I haven't had really like any mentors. And I don't need to like get deep on you guys. But I want the audience to know that like doing entertainment and vlogging and putting your whole entire life out there. Doing all of these sorts of things is a lot of stress. And sometimes everything just moves so fast that like you can't even calculate it or comprehend it. Like I said over the past week like it's been crazy. And I first want to apologize to my brother for the diss track. Like I in no way meant to like hurt his feelings. I thought it would be funny and like entertaining. And it was like making me laugh really hard. It was making like my friends laugh really hard. And we did it like all in one day. And like we had this like high build up. And we just like wanted to get it done and like put it out there. But afterwards I realized like it wasn't right of my brother to talk smack about my song that I made. But it also wasn't right for me to then make a diss track roasting him. I thought of those things as like jokes. And I thought everyone knew that I was like somewhat joking. I was more trying to be playful versus like actually hurting anyone's feelings. And the next people I want to apologize to are the low gang. Again like it's always been like this friendly thing like Jake Pauler's versus Low Gang. And like pranking each other and saying like who's better who's this. And it's always been this like kind of friendly thing. And I think I took it too far without even realizing it until afterwards. So I want to say I'm sorry low gang. And like I'm a part of the low gang. Like without my brother I wouldn't be where I am today. And I think he can say the same thing. And we've been on this incredible journey together and he is hilarious. He is so energetic like his videos are amazing. And I respect him a lot as a creator. And he has way more followers than me when you add everything up together. And so I thought people would think it was a joke. Like by me saying like I have more subscribers than him. Like that's literally the only platform I think I have more followers than him on. It kind of like spun out of control. People were taking it like two seriously and so I was really regretful. So sorry low gang and sorry low gang again. And I also want to apologize to the wide don't we poise who like weren't even really sane. And they were there when Logan was talking trash about my song. But that's really it. Like so wide don't we, I apologize. Everyone knows they're super talented. And so I thought people would obviously be like okay he's joking. And I also want to like touch on the song that I made. It's every day bro. There's been a lot of like backlash on the song which is completely fine. Like haters are gonna hate. But I do want to just say like again it's a joke. Like I'm not a rapper. PewDiePie has so much more clout than I do. Like yes I get more views than him sometimes. But like he has literally like 20 times more subscribers than I do. And so again I thought people would like take it as a joke. I thought it was funny again. Like I was making the video for myself. And all these videos are for myself. If I'm not happy with them, I'm not gonna put them out. I don't really make these videos to make someone else happy. I make them because I like to watch them later and laugh at them. I want to just say sorry to anyone who like thought I was actually trying to rap. Or actually like try to create a song. Again it really wrote that in an hour. Or to anyone who was like dist in the song. I realized after that it didn't seem like that at all. But again when you're sometimes just like caught up in the moment. I'm sure you guys can relate to this. Like when you're caught up in a moment sometimes things just happen. And they just fire out of control. And I know there's a lot of people reacting to the video and talking smack about it. And that's totally fine. And I've seen some of the videos and I think they're funny. I don't know I think that covers anything. If anyone else says it was offended by the video or my actions in the past week. You know I feel like I have it myself. Like I came home and I was like something's wrong with me. And I needed to like just rant. I don't even know what I'm saying. But like I apologize for my actions in the past week. And hopefully you guys can accept my apology. And I hate to be down like this too. Like I'm always trying to be positive and bring everyone up. But again this is real life. And that's what I want to end this right now is like sometimes if you're like not feeling okay guys. Or if you feel like something's wrong or if you did something wrong. Or you just feel bad about a situation. Don't be afraid to own up to it. And there's probably stuff that I didn't apologize for that I said in the past. And I don't mean to be like cocky or anything with my videos. Sometimes like the jokes. And I'm just like a 20 year old kid being stupid in Los Angeles. And enjoying life with my friends. And so sometimes that comes across like bad. I'm sorry again. And guys if you are ever feeling like this or something like don't be afraid to own up to it. Like I am right now. But Jake Paulers like as always keep your head high. I love you guys. And I want to say thank you to all the Jake Paulers who come back on a day to day basis and watch my life. And we've created a family. And it's been such a crazy ride. And so much goes on on a day to day basis. And sometimes it's hard to reflect on that. Or to think about every little thing that you're doing or to think about not making this mistake. But Jake Paulers you guys are amazing. I seriously owe everything I have to you guys. Without you I wouldn't be where I am. This is just the star of the journey. And we're just buckling up. So thank you so much for the support. Keep on working hard. Keep on dabbing on them haters. Keep on smiling. Keep on plugging. March Lincoln, bio. And Jake Paulers. I will see you tomorrow because it's every day. Oh, please. Jake Paulers what's poppin check out this new merch.

015_Blaire,"Okay, so this is a video that I really did not expect to ever make, ever. But those are always the most interesting ones, right? And I know that it's a few times, but I really ask that for those of you who are going to comment something angry or tweet about this or write about this on your websites that you please just watch the video in its entirety with an open mind because I have a feeling that there's going to be a lot of assumptions made about what I'm going to say in this video rather than what I'm actually going to say. And I just want things to be accurate and told properly. If you keep up with my channel and with the community that I'm a part of here on YouTube and the internet, you recognize the name and face, Riley Dennis. Now Riley is someone who I have a lot of vehement disagreements with. Someone who ideologically I have probably close to nothing in common with. So among all the things that I've taken issue with when it comes to Riley, Islam, the date me or your discriminating against me thing, misgendering is an act of violence, all of that stuff. One of the biggest things that I took issue with was that I assume that Riley was taking on a transgender identity and label for political purposes, transgender. Now I had a lot of reasons to believe this. The first being a statement from Riley about growing up and never questioning their gender. As a trans person myself, that's very weird to hear. I was growing up my earliest memories in life were that of questioning my gender and of questioning the gender role that I was expected to fill. So as a trans person I couldn't get in the headspace of what? How did you never question it? Another example is Riley's statements that trans people don't always want to transition. And again, as a trans person who's known many trans people, I couldn't wrap my hat around that because for me, in transition was incredibly paramount. It was the key to me living the fulfilled life that I live now. I was also under the assumption as hundreds of thousands of other people were that Riley had no desire to transition and that Riley was not transitioning, that Riley was just taking on the label of trans with no real action behind it. However, Riley recently made a video that completely shifted my opinion in that regard. In this video, Riley reveals that she's been on hormones for an entire year and is actually going in for her first transition specific surgery extremely soon. The day this video is going live, I'm going to be on my way to San Francisco in preparation for my facial feminization surgery or FFS for short. But the fact is I am on hormone replacement therapy prescribed to me by my doctor for the treatment of gender dysphoria. I've been on hormones for about 10 or 11 months now. And this entire time I've been very careful not to talk about hormones online. Needless to say, this completely came out of left field for me and for me to say anything other than I feel bad would be disingenuous. My opinion of Riley has changed as a result of this new information. Not of Riley's opinions, not of Riley's views, not of Riley's politics, but of Riley being trans or not. Riley as a human being, all the other stuff aside. Point blank, my perception that Riley was lying about being trans or pretending to be trans was just incorrect. And for me to not come on here and correct that after the amount of response videos I've made where I assert just that, one of them being just less than two weeks ago would be wrong. Riley's video really got me thinking and I feel bad. Not for criticizing Riley on Islam, not for criticizing Riley on Trump, not Riley's politics, any of that. I don't regret any of that. But the incestant push to prove that Riley was not trans and just realizing was probably really hurtful. And I'm aware that there's no way I would have known before the video where Riley actually discloses this information, but I feel like I was still in the wrong for trying to assume what was in someone's heart in mind when there was just simply no way I could have known. With or without Riley disclosing that information, there was no way I ever could have truly known. And as a YouTuber myself, I should have just known better. People do the same thing to me. People make insane assumptions about me. People assume things that I feel and lie about me constantly. So for me to do that to someone else, I feel bad. And I've just genuinely felt this shift in me, you guys, knowing that this entire time that I've been being honestly cruel about Riley being trans or not being trans, this entire time Riley was going through that same journey that I have been going through. You know, transition is very rigorous, transition is very intense, transition is hard, and I can only imagine what it would feel like to have a trans YouTuber making videos and saying some of the things that I said. And again, I don't regret criticizing the beliefs and the opinions, but attacking who Riley was as a person, I shouldn't have done that. And what I'm going to say next is probably going to shock you guys because it shocked me. And this is the part that really put things into perspective for me. I've only been on hormones a year longer than Riley. Riley is getting her first transition specific surgery this month. So am I. We are basically at the same boy in our transition yet the internet and myself have participated in this like false juxtaposition between me and Riley that I was a real trans person. Riley was a fake trans person. And the truth is, we're almost at the exact same point in our transition. And I'm someone who's had my transition picked apart online. There have been Reddit threads and 4chan threads with hundreds of comments on it of people trying to prove that I'm not trans because I haven't done this or that or you know, digging up my old pictures and you know, I'm a strong person. I'm a happy person. But to sit here and pretend like it doesn't affect me at all would just be a lie. So the thought that this entire time I've done that exact same thing to someone else and push that off on someone else. Fucks with me. And I'm fucking sorry. From my perspective knowing what it takes to transition, the tens of thousands of dollars it takes to save up for these surgeries to take that plunge and to step into that is difficult. And to know that this is getting kind of hard to film and I'm fucking frustrated. Having gone through that myself and knowing that Riley went through that and that during the process of Riley doing that, Riley had this trans person on YouTube making videos saying some of the things that I said is really messing with me and I feel really fucking bad. You know, this whole thing has really taught me a lesson that I should really try to stick to ideas, opinions, policy rather than like trying to get in someone's head and like make judgments about something that's so personal and so nuanced. I will say in this moment, Riley, I apologize. I'm genuinely from my core. Sorry. Being caddy and bitchy and funny is great but sometimes things just cross the line and on several occasions I cross the line. And I'm sorry. That's about it guys. I'm sorry for getting emotional in this video. I just felt compelled to say these things and I hope you guys understand. I hope you guys are subscribed to me for the right reasons not because you guys want me to do this really bad assing and be this constant like rigid character because like I'm a person and if I feel like something needs to be said, regardless of if it's my typical video or my typical behavior, I'm just going to say it. This is just me. So yeah, okay. I guess that's it. And before I go, I'll just congratulate Riley on transitioning from one gender to the only other gender. That's only two. Had to get one job in. Okay, just one job. See you guys in the next video."
016_Kenna," My cards are all out on the table now. Will you look or will you fold? Am I a human? Am I a monster? Or am I something in between? You see, I tried to be the hero, that's not real. I've done bad things. I've told tales, false regales, I've thrown pebbles, sticks and stones. I've hurt people and behind covers. It made me feel much less alone. Most times I wouldn't see the faults I made till tables turned. And once they did, I knew how which is felt to be accused against their word. And sometimes I think assumptions just might be the death of me. For I assume that people know the things I think and things I see. And when others make assumptions of their own eyes and their own mind, that's when trouble surely follows. Because assumptions lead to lies. I wasn't trying to take the credit. I was never trying to deceive. But people often fail to listen once there is something they believe. And it's so easy for tales to twist, thoughts to mix and words to spread. And it's so easy to pass on judgment when all you can see is red. But I know I'm not the victim here. For my carelessness made things unclear. And for that, I'll accept my fate. And I'll learn from my mistakes. For I am someone who slips often. I fear my bed is my own coffin. But I won't lay to rest just yet. Even if I'm in over my head. And I'm sorry. Hear me, I'm sorry. For me, that's somehow hard to say. You see, when people demand apologies, I tend to run away. I'm not sure why it's something deep inside. A fault I need to fix. My spoken words won't seem to work. And so instead, I resort to this. And apology through poetry is me in my rost form. I hope you'll hear these words. I hope they'll mean something. I hope they'll mend what I have torn. Although I know for some this won't be enough. I hope the rest will hear me out. For this is my apology. My white flag waving proud. Am I a human? Am I a monster? Or am I just a living thing? Am I good? Or am I evil? I think we're all just in between."
017_Felix," Hello, I wanted to make a statement on what I said in my previous livestream. You probably won't believe me when I say this, but whenever I go online and I hear other players use the same kind of language that I did, I always find it extremely immature and stupid, and I hate how I now personally fed into that part of gaming as well. It was something that I said in the heat of the moment, I said the worst word I could possibly think of, and it just sort of slipped out. And I'm not gonna make any excuses to why it did, because there are no excuses for it. I'm disappointed in myself, because it seems like I've learned nothing from all these past controversies. And it's not that I think I can say or do whatever I want and get away with it. That's not it at all. I'm just an idiot. But that doesn't make what I said or how I said it, okay, it was not okay. I'm really sorry if I offended, hurt, or disappointed anyone with all of this. Being in the position I am, I should know better. I know I can keep missing up like this. And I owe it to my audience and to myself to do better than this, because I know I'm better than this. I really want to improve myself and better myself, not just for me, but for anyone that looks up to me or anyone that's influenced by me. And that's how I want to move forward away from this. That's all I have to say. Thank you for watching. Bye."
018_Repo,"Yeah, I am. I fucked up. Now, I'm well aware that making this video and talking about this and responding to the Jacolins recent video, I'm definitely going to lose some fans. I'm going to lose some friends. But there's two sides to every story. I wouldn't really call this a defense. I understand what I did. I understand that it's pretty wrong and heinous. Like I said, I messed up. So I guess I would like to explain some things. I just finished watching Jacolins video and all the brutal graphic details that she explained to everyone. So I'd like to give some very descriptive details of my own. Not to slander Jacolins or anything, just to kind of give you a deeper context on why I did what I did. I do deeply regret it. I feel like Jacolins and I, we overall had a really fun and happy relationship. The happy parts were great. It kind of was a classic case of showing the best parts of your relationship on social media. So everyone thinks everything just peaches and roses all the time and it's just not. It's a lie. We were happy but there's obviously a dark side to everything. Clearly, yeah, everyone was incredibly devastated when they heard that we had broken up because I did cheat on her. Just like I did my ex-girlfriend, whichever one knows about because of our best friend. It's interesting because right after I ended that relationship, we finally closed the book on that one and I wasn't faithful to a tie-la either. I made a video because her and Oni sound were ganging up on me and I said, I will never, ever, ever have a public relationship again. And then a couple months later, not even a couple months, it was like a month later, I met Jacolins and she was perfect. She was an atheist. She, I don't know, she just, she cared so much about me and just everything that I did and I did care about her and I don't know, everything just made sense. But clearly, I have a lot of deep-seated issues. I have a lot of things that I haven't addressed and she kind of took me on with the thought that she could fix me and that, you know, there obviously, there's a lot of good parts that she saw in me and I commend her for that but at the same time, you know, everyone did warn her and I don't know, it just sucks that I approved them all right. I did and I couldn't stay faithful and here we are. I should have just broken it off early and just not been a shithead about it but I didn't. I always kind of felt this unbalanced in the relationship even early on which terrified me and I could never bring it up to her. All the way we dated for 11 months and I could never talk to her about it just because I was so afraid because she got so attached to me so quickly. She was just, it's almost like she just, after months two or three, she was like ready to settle down with me and ready to get a house and it just seemed so perfect and I was like, what are you doing? Of course I went along with it because I'm an idiot and I just don't, I'm clearly not very good with relationships and I just shouldn't, I should have ended it early. I mean, obviously we had amazing time together even all the way up until last week but there's no excuse for not being faithful to someone you promised monogamy too. So there's no excuse for that and maybe I'll try to go into therapy. I don't know, I told her I don't agree with therapy because I've tried it before and it just, I don't feel like it works. We had to talk about my depression and how I should maybe get medicated. I also don't agree with that. And I think the best solution to make sure I don't do this again and I don't hurt anyone else is to just not date anymore, not for a long time. It's not worth it. It's not worth watching these decent people whether it be Jaclyn or Isla, obviously I did Jaclyn a lot longer and hurt her a lot more. I just can't, I can't be in relationships just because I just, I can't do it and clearly I don't have the restraint for it. Maybe I have a sex problem. I don't know. You just, what it comes down to is just don't, don't make promises you can't keep and I made a promise I couldn't keep and it is devastating her right now and I have to live with that for the rest of my life. You know, it, I think ultimately we just wanted different things and I couldn't reconcile with that and I decided to be a child and she wants to be an adult and you know be a real person and I guess I just wasn't ready to do that and that's what led me to talk to one of my ex-girlfriends. So, I just would like to say that I'm sorry to anyone that looks up to me or that follows me. I feel, geez, I'd feel like I kind of lost my way. A lot, at some point with this channel, at least in the past six months, originally it was all about art and music and kind of statements that I wanted to make and instead it just kind of turned into videos highlighting my relationships and my personal life which ultimately I just, that's not why I do this, that's not why and I, she made a point in her video talking about how even a couple days ago when she had gone through my phone and found those things that I couldn't, I couldn't stop talking about the tour and that I couldn't just turn off for a couple hours and just talk about our relationship and it's clearly I'm a careerist. I'm, I'm so deeply entrenched in social repose just as an entity that it does, it comes first, it comes before all my love and relationships and even family to an extent. This is my life, I've chosen it and I put my all into it and you know some might look at me like I'm a sociopath for doing that but I'm, I guess I'm really passionate about it and I'm a little hurt that she kind of broadcasted everything. I'm not hurt that she talked about the cheating I knew she would have to talk about it, talk about that at some point but to go into such graphic detail feels a little unnecessary but it's out there so can't stop it and yeah I guess I'm just I'm sorry, I'm sorry I let you guys down, I'm going to do better. I'm going to make more art and more music and if you don't want to follow me anymore because you think I'm a shitty person or because I'm disgusting or because I just, you can't stand the thought of ever watching me again because of what I did to Jacqueline. I can't make you stay but I promise you I'll do better with my videos and my content and you know I'm, it's just it's always important to strive to just be better when you know that you've fucked up and you know that you've ruined somebody and I can't take back what I did but I can look in the future and prevent it from ever happening again so for all the people that want to shit all over me each her heart out I deserve it I deserve all of it she deserves no hate for any of this and I didn't mean to send her any hate I've been just very emotional because touring is hard and I'm sorry that those tweets saying that I'm alone out here may have sent her hate in some way because they didn't know the context of the situation I didn't mean it that way and she deserves all the love in the world so that's all I have to say and yeah okay"
019_Zoe,"Hello! Good morning! It is Thursday! One more day to the weekend! I actually fell asleep at like half-nine last night so I'm feeling quite energized. What's the time now? I think I've been awake since 7. I'm kind of 6.45ish. But yeah, I'm feeling energized. I've got quite busy day today. I've got a meeting which I'm very, very excited about. And I think that's at like 9.30 so I need to get ready. I need to have my breakfast and I'm going to tidy up the kitchen a little bit. And yeah! Already for the day. I started doing a time lapse of me doing my makeup and then my battery died and I didn't realise until I was like halfway through doing my eyes. So sorry about that. But this is my makeup today. I feel like I look very tired. I didn't actually sleep very well last night. Now that was so annoying. I let her sleep in the bed because Alfie wasn't here and I was lonely. But she just kept waking up. Look, she knows I'm talking about her. She kept waking up getting out of the duvet, scratching, like really hard. And then trying to buried, go back underneath the duvet. She probably did that like 20 times in the night. So tonight, Natalie, you're going back in your bed. I gave you one chance and you blew it. Right, what was I doing? Oh, I was going to make a big jug of lovely icy lemon water for our meeting. Let's use this for a ride. It's not a very big jug. I need bigger jugs. Mmm, mint. Get a lemon. Why am I taking such pride in a jug of bloody water? I'm like no, I will make this the most perfect jug of lemon and mint water you ever did see. Done. Now let's take this up to the office. There's a little bit later on. In fact, it's much, much later on. But I have had a very productive non-vloggable. Hello, finished your dinner? Non-vloggable meeting. And then after that, we were just getting on with lots of work. I'm going to sit in my little chair. It's nice. Although this chair does make me feel like motion sick. It's just like hovers. Alfie's just called me. He is boarding his plane. And I think what I'm going to do, if you're up for that as well, Nala, is... Oh my god, what was that? Oh my god. I think what I'm going to do, and if Nala's up for it as well, is I'm going to watch the rest of Call Midwife, which I put on this morning, because I think it still paused on my TV downstairs. And I'm going to answer. I have a few press requests, which is Q&A's for certain magazines or publications that I have to do. So I'm going to sit and do that. Maybe put some cozy clothes on, and tidy up the meeting room a little bit. Look what was brought to the meeting. Oh, there's one left. Percy, Merry Percy, miss. There are Percy Pigs, but with freaking Christmas hats on. Like how cute are these? Amazing, and there's one left. So maybe I'll have to eat that one. Really successful day. I'm really happy. So I'm sorry I can't really vlog it. I feel like this is a pretty pointless day for me to vlog. But hopefully our film will come back soon, and there's still the evening that everyone has left now. So I've got my camera out to fill you in on what you missed. And the meeting room is all tidy. If it wants to focus, yay! Oh, I need to show you, because I'm really proud of it. I had lots of sourced boxes that me and Alfie hadn't opened or been through. So I took it upon myself to steal all the things inside the sourced boxes, and put all the snacks into one of my little Zola lifestyle tins. And actually, this proved very well received today. Everyone was like taking out little snacks from there, which I really liked. Love this picture of me and Mark. Also, how cute is this? I've got a couple on the side. I've got these ones of me and Poppy, which we took at the sea life centre in Brighton. Then there's more of me and Mark. I literally love this photo. I feel like that photo sums up our entire friendship. And then he wrote me this cute little message on one of my Zola cards. Do Zola congrats on your new BT range. It smells and feels incredible. You should be ever so proud of yourself. All me love Mark. I think he literally wrote that set next to me one day when I was working up here. Love it. I also have another because that wasn't big enough for all the snacks. I have another one here, which is kind of like more crispy packets rather than bars. But so far, they went down very well. I think everyone appreciates a healthy snack in long meetings. Also, a lot of you have been tweeting me because you've seen this. This is Collective Hub. It's a magazine that I am currently on the front cover of, which is cool. This is one of the shots that Alex Cameron took of me down in Brighton. That time, I really like it. The day of being in the office. Done. I actually really, really like having office space. I think it makes me more productive and it's really nice to share that with people. So, like today, for example, I had all the people I was meeting for the meeting. And it was just nice. I'm a very creative person and I think it's really nice to be around other creative people. And for everyone's creative juices to be flowing, those are my favourite meetings. And that was essentially what that kind of meeting was. So, they're the ones that I always leave feeling so motivated and so excited and so pumped and so driven. Come on, babes. This way. I still need to put these on the wall. Come on in. Fine. Oh, do you know what, guys? I've had a PO box delivery and I wanted to show you some of the cool things. Oh, Nala, you're going to want to come in here, aren't you? Firstly, this basket. I don't know who sent this, but I flip and love it and I want to get a cheese plant in this, like, stat. Just anything with pom-poms, I bloody love this. I thought, looked so exciting. The Working Woman's Handbook by Phoebe Lovett. Another thing that I am very excited about is a Huda Beauty Winter Highlight palette. Oh, my God. These colours look in sane. Ah, frosted kiss. Oh, my gosh. I mean, I love a highlighter palette. Anyway, where are you going? What are you exploring? And then I also got the Brown Edition Liquid Matte Minis. You guys know how I feel about Liquid Matte Lipsticks. And then some lashes. They look very nice. And a warm brown obsession palette. Oh, this sounds bright up in my street. Look at this. Go. Look how beautiful that looks. All the colours that I love. Very pigmented as well. Oh, I'm going to take that downstairs. We're going to take that straight downstairs and put it straight in my makeup bag. Another thing, or sorry, no. You're getting in the way. Another thing that came to my PO box, which made me, beyond excited, is the Monopoly Brighton and Hove Edition. Can you play Monopoly with two players? Because I think I might make Alfie play this with me tonight. That would be cute, wouldn't it? Hi, boys and welcome back. We're having a game with Monopoly. It'll probably last four hours because there's only two of us. Oh, two to six players. Well, Alfie's got a wild night ahead of him. Oh, okay. So this looked insane. You guys know I love the NYX Lip. This is one of their Christmas gifts, I guess. And it's the lingerie vault. So there are lots of little mini NYX lingerie lipsticks. I only shades are there in there. I mean, there's loads. 30 piece. A 30 piece set. What else do we have here? This looks so cool. So, nails ink, which you are probably familiar with because they do really great nail polishes, etc. have released a makeup line called Ink Credible. I mean, look at this like these acrylic drawers. They're amazing. What do we have? I haven't looked in this at all. Oh my god. Okay. So far, I'm drawn to this. Which is probably a lip gloss. I don't wear lip glosses. But in a dream world, iridescent sheer gloss. Oh my god. I just... Can you see that? Oh, it's so pretty. What else do we have? Okay. Some amazing lip glosses. Oh, enriched with vitamin E. Nice. Foyling around. Um, metallic lip paint. Nice. Pushing everyday out of office, enhanced with chodoboil. Semi matte lip click. Oh, I love the sound of these. I really like this packaging. It's very like... I don't know. And then we have more foil colors here as well. Glazing over. Intense color lip glaze. These look really nice. And then lip tripping iridescent lip strobe. What the hell is a lip strobe? Oh, like a lipstick, but like super glittery. Oh, it's like thrusted. There's some really nice colors in here. This one in particular looks very dreamy. And then last look by Nomean's Least. Oh, hey, what is a jelly shot? Lip quencher hydrate. Ooh, watch me go. Advanced with avocado oil. It's flipping green. Ooh. Oh, that's nice. I like that. And then we also have matte my day liquid lip paint. Okay, well, I'm sold. These are definitely the sort of... The sort of thing I naturally gravitate towards. These colors in particular. This one is hustle hard girl, which is like a really lovely, like, nudie pink. And then this one is, you won't bring me down. And it's like a really browny nude. Okay, I'm really excited to go through these. Thank you so much, nails ink. Or ink credible. I'm very excited to try that. Okay, Nala, getting a little bit annoyed at none of this is for you. That's very selfish. Sometimes those things are for you, but not always. Okay, we've had this conversation. There won't always be treats in the peer box. Not always. I mean, 90% of the time, she's a very lucky pooch. Okay, and then the last thing. Oh my god, I don't know if I can actually lift this. And this, if you can't see already, is a ginormous box of Fenty Beauty by Rihanna. I mean, what on earth did I do to deserve this? Look at it. It's insane. This is everything she released. And I'm talking everything. I think I'm going to sneeze. Oh, sorry, Nala, I didn't scare you. The very kind and generous people at Fenty Beauty have sent me an entire treasure trove of the entire Fenty Beauty collection. I have already talked about how much I love the foundation. Multiple times. Oh my god, yay, I have another foundation brush. I'm really new to wash, but I was like too scared to wash it and not be able to use it. This foundation brush is amazing. I'm going to bring you down here, I think. Look, there's one of these cool things. There she is. I was pretty nervous, I got it. I remember, I remember. I love it. Okay, now how do I pause it? There we go. Okay, so, Profil to Soft Matte Longwear Foundation. Oh, we have the primer. I didn't buy this, so I'm excited to give that a try. You're looking me. We've got the matchsticks. We have these. Oh my goodness. I didn't order this one, actually. This one looks bangin', blotting powder. Oh my god. So I don't really use blotting powder, but Mark will love this. And then down here, portable highlighter brush. I didn't realise the packaging was like, can you see that? It's like glittery. I did not know that. I swear mine wasn't glittery. The cheek hugging highlight brush, which I also recommend. Precision makeup sponge. Oh, and then we've got all the Nala. And then we've got all, oh, she can smell lips. She can smell the lip stuff on the back of my hand. Yes, no, don't eat that. Which are the matchsticks. There's so many. Wow. Okay. Holy moly. Obviously, guys, these are not all my skin tones. So maybe I should do a giveaway. If any of you are watching this and you're like, I would so be that shade or this one's my shade, please send it to me. Send me a little like Instagram DM or something. And I will try and send some of these out because I'm not going to use all of these. Although very kind of them to send it because is it not literally so unreal how many shades? This isn't even all the shades. Let me pull this out because these are also the shades. Oh my goodness. There are so many shades of this foundation. And I actually love this foundation. I've used it pretty much every day since I bought it. And I'm really happy about this because I've just done a make-up look where I was mixing two different colours together. And that's essentially what I've been doing. So at least this gives me the opportunity to find out the exact number that I am. Which is the one I bought. This one which was warm and then I bought 200 which is cool. So just the complete opposite then. Warm and cool. Amazing. Honestly, that is extremely generous. So thank you very very much Fenty Beauty. I am so excited to try out some of the bits that I didn't get. But also distribute out Fenty foundation to anyone who wants it because it is really really good. Right, I am going to go downstairs now because I have those interviews to do. So shall we go Nala? I also think I might bring an apple here. Go in there. Because I do really want to play it. Yaaaas! Look at Nala by the fire. Oh sorry, she's just kidding you. Call the midwife's on. I'm about to get into this blanket. I've got my joggers on. And I'm going to write up these interviews. Oh, I love it. Good morning and happy Friday everybody. I am wearing my trusty. I've got like the dry slips ever and I think it's because it's just got really cold. And we've got the radiators on. But I'm wearing my trusty clarons. Instant light lip comfort oil which I mean I was obsessed with this like most of last year. And I haven't really worn it much this year but I love it. It's actually still really early and I've decided this morning that we're all going to go to the garden center together. I'll be got back last night at like midnight. I did that thing where I fell asleep and then I woke up to him like next to me. It proper like shook me. I was like oh my god. You're right this morning. Oh my god it was the cutest thing. I'll see if she'll do it again. But I was on my Twitter timeline and I followed Doug the pug. And there was a photo of him and Nala instantly just pressed her face up against the screen. It wasn't even a video it was just a photo. And then on the Doug the pug Twitter and Instagram I think. They've done a stranger pugs too. They did one for stranger things and now all this stranger things too is out. They've done a second one. And it's like the best thing I've ever seen. And Nala was just watching it this morning. And I honestly think she enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed the human version. She is mesmerized. Guys the John Lewis Christmas advert is out. I feel like a monster under the bed isn't going to be sad though. And I quite like the ones that really tug on your heartstrings and make me cry because I'm an emotional wreck. And I like things like that. And I feel like this isn't going to be that. And last year wasn't that for me either. So I'm going to wait for our feed to get out the shower and stop listening to the same song 80 million times. And then I think we should watch it together. Oh my god we match. We did. I like this. This is me. Yeah. This is new for me too. That's cool. Yeah are you ready to watch this? I don't think it's going to be a tug on your heartstrings. Must the monster. Yeah. Are you ready? It's cute isn't it? Yeah. Right let's go. Oh look at the little boy. I know. Where is it going? I think it's a little boy. Oh no. I legit thought that. Oh. Once there was a way. So I have a nala in the bedroom. I know it. So I have a new in the bedroom. You more like. This is Elbow singing this. He's spending all his nights playing with the monster so he's tired in the day. I can't get it. Do you get it? Is it that he's? Maybe that the monster has gone back home once he could see what this dark see where he was. I mean like he was scared of the dark and there was a monster under the bed in the dark. And then when he had a night light the monster wasn't there. Then he wasn't scared of the monster. Yeah it wasn't scared. He wanted to play with the monster so I just wanted to play with the monster. It's a really cute advert. But I was right. It's not like a tug on your heart strings. I wonder why they're not doing those advert anymore. I wonder if they're going to sell mozzas. I think they are. And the night light. And the night light. Oh the ones you buy will be small. Oh yeah I know. That's why in here you should have been small. What do you guys think? I prefer the John Lewis Adverts that really like tug at your heart strings personally. I always have preferred those. Last year I liked the advert but it wasn't like emotional. And I feel that's where. Yeah and I do feel that the emotional ones is where people really like connect with them and they like rewatch them. And they talk about them with everyone like oh my god did you see that advert? I was in tears. I feel that people are more connected. Which was your favourite one? My favourite one. Okay so I loved the bear and the rabbit. Yeah. Love that. Can we watch the Aldi one quickly? Because apparently this one's really great and I've not seen this one. Oh and an answer to your which is my favourite one. My ultimate ultimate favourite John Lewis Christmas advert was 2011 where the little boy looked like he was really excited to get presents on Christmas Day. Yeah. Actually he really wanted to give them all. Oh my god she was just realised. No the penguin one was amazing as well. Oh my god I'm the penguin one, Monty the penguin. Yeah look there. That one was insane. Ground. I love these Aldi carrot ones. Look how cute it is. Yo she's hot. I think I just peed myself. So are carrots and age trash? It's like the Titanic. Oh I like that. I like that. Have you seen this one? I really like that. No I haven't seen this one. But this is turning into like reacting to every Christmas. Jar of Marmalade. Thank you Santa. Oh I've got loads more to deliver. Do you see what you're doing? I'm not under there. This man was trying to steal the presents now he's making the hymn for them back. Merry Christmas Mr. Claus. That's such a good bear. Christmas. That's good. Yeah I like that one. So what is your favourite Christmas advert? Oh my god the man on the moon. That one was so good to do. 28 million views. Oh my gosh let's watch this. This song as well. This isn't actually me as a kid. Oh my eyes. Can we stop watching these now? This is the one. Oh my god I can't watch this honestly. I can't watch this. Please please. He doesn't care about his presents. Get what I want. Oh. Oh no. It would be the first time. Oh his little face. He's wrapped it in slow. Right can we go now and stop watching these? This one was good too. This one's quite a mow. You caught it. Yes. It's just watery eyes. Not real. So we put now this harness on, put a cute little coat on, got a lead out, got ready to go to the garden centre. Then Alfie was like oh no I've got a conference call. I was like oh no so then Alfie was like I can't go. I was like oh well I can go and then he was like no you've got a call. And he could see my diary in his face and he was like you've got a call as well. Oh damn it. So our morning plans are a little scuppered. But I've got my call. Alfie's got his call and then. I think we might be able to go to the garden centre after that. But there's other things I can be getting on with anyway. So I just really wanted to get out the house. Oh well we can manage to get out the house a little bit. She's being really naughty though. Come on. It's a good job this was just a quick walk. Nala. Look at her, look how cute. I feel like all my vlogs are just me sat here with this bloody ostrich in the background. I've been in an impromptu meeting over in Alfie's office for a while. Oh my god how, how do I look like this? Like I've been trying to throw a hedge back because of the pineapple on my head. And now I'm making my way through a box of cabbri's heroes waiting for Alfie to finish up. It's like nearly half, I was supposed to say half eight, half six. I've just edited another vlog. Woohoo! I'm on a roll with the edit. And Naomi is coming over this evening which I'm really excited about because I only briefly got to see her at Tanya's book launch. So it'll be really nice to catch up with her. I don't know what we're going to do. I think we're just going to chill, watch a film, maybe play a game. I still want to play that bright and hope monopoly. I'm going to lie and three people is better than two. So I think we should play it. We'll see. We'll see what they want to do. I also don't know what we're doing for dinner. I don't think that looks nice. You're doing matches. No, I think this is here. And we were just having a conversation about what would we all be doing right now if me and Alfie had never met. I was so weird. Or just like, I wouldn't know you. No, we wouldn't. We wouldn't know. Time, let's just make a mental. Yeah, it's so weird. I just find it really weird even thinking about like if you didn't do the one timeiest thing. If I didn't like Alfie's video. Imagine if I like didn't search something that popped up like with Marcus's age or something or... Now why did you search to find my video? I have no idea. I'll be ready before you like to do the video. I think I... Here's one I'm one fan. My first time. No, I think my first time. We were signed to the same network. And I think I must have been like, well who else is on this network? Or there must have been an email or something you were included in. And I think originally I found Marcus's videos. Really? And then I found yours through Marcus because I'm... It all in the same day. So I must have found like a collab that you did through a video of Marcus's. Probably. And then I was watching all your like... Do you remember Alfie's first videos which were like ten things I hate about people in relationships? And like... You know it was like things like that. Ten things girls do. Yeah. That was Marcus. That was Marcus. That was Marcus. You have videos like that. I've got a couple. You have got videos. Like Alfie's kind of shining moments on YouTube is definitely the chicken nugget. Yeah. Yeah. I love those own videos. And then I think I just liked one. I don't remember which one I liked but it was like... It was like talking something deep. It was something I was like, get like, because basically there was a... Do more of what makes you happy. It could have been that but no. Point one. One point oh. That's number one. No, but there was basically... We went to the same party. But that was... Alf, was there? It was there. Yeah. With our network. Reason you went to the parties because you watched my video. No, it isn't. Oh, you want to see more? I promise you. This is from the DMs. My video was really deep and I saw him like in life you've got to do things you want to do and stuff. You liked it and then I remember when we met or when we first met. Oh my god, you're so right. It's because I wasn't going to go and you made me want to just do it because for me. You are so right. I just remembered that because I remember messaging you. Alf, are you weird? Alf, are you weird? Alf, are you weird? I've just had like a flashback where I was messaging you before leaving to go. But then we didn't actually speak to each other at the party. It was a bit weird. No, we didn't. No, we didn't. We didn't message for the party. Yes, we did. No, you must have been commenting on the video or something. We didn't message. Oh, I must have commented on the video then. Yeah, we didn't message. How funny. That's crazy. Yeah. Did you know who I was at that party or not? No, not at all. No idea. You didn't think who is that fitty over there? Do you own your black trousers or remember? Your black disco pants. You have to have those. Oh my god, how weird would it be if like not have been happened? Yeah, Louise was there. Sammy was there, did you got it? Yeah, yeah. Louise. Oh, Louise. Marker. Louise there. Yeah, Louise was there. Yeah. I really want to find that video now where I have a video of that party. Did you look it? Yeah, I've logged it. It's like that. Shall we watch it? Yeah. Guys, this was the video that I liked of Alfies that we were just talking about. Look, there's the little cheeky thumbs up. I mean, there's not the best screenshot of you. And you're showing the thumbs up. What do you mean? What? The fact that you gave that thumbs up, then everyone commented into it? Yeah. Yeah. Because then everyone could see that I liked it and that's how you discovered me. And then he's like, hit me up on scope. Here's my scope name. Which, no, I mean, it wasn't far off that. And then he got the five hour scope, because I saw the whole grid. No. No, I wasn't. You need to stop saying that as part of the story. You need to make it on Skype. No, I didn't. It was so good. I was not going to just count. I answered the Skype with my boobs out like, oh, hello. What's this thing you hear? Or first thing you hear. But Alfie was very forward. I was not forward. You just said in your own vlog that you weren't forward. And that is not like you at all. You answered, you asked it. Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? No. It's funny. It's cute. That was a long time ago. So I was editing this vlog that you have just watched. And I thought I would put this little bit in at the end, because there has been some upsets disappointed people in these, well, they're a lifestyle advent calendar, more specifically the price of the calendar. And I didn't want to not address it, because I want you guys to know I do care about how you feel about things. And the last thing I want to do is anger, upset, or disappoint anyone, because that is not my intention in the slightest. So I thought it would be weird for me to kind of end this vlog like this, whilst there's people that are upset with the calendar price. The calendar is something I've worked on for a year. I love the product. I am all about the creativity. I'm all about getting it from a design to a product. Where my input ends is there. Once that product is done, I'm happy with it. The retailer can decide how much they sell that for. That's completely out of my decision making. I don't have the right to make those decisions. So it makes me so sad that a product that I loved and worked hard on, and that loads of you like the product, it is just having that product at the price that was out of my decision, has left so many people so upset. And I feel just as let down by this also. And the price of any product is up to a retailer. And I know that there's some of you that might not have known that. So I wanted to come on here and explain that to you, because even my mum didn't realise that. I don't want people to think that I'm set at home counting 50 pounds every time someone buys this calendar, that that was a conscious decision that I made to rip people off. Because if you know me, you know that there is not a bone in my body that would think that way. And it makes me so sad that anyone would think that that was my intention, because that is 100% not my intention. My intention was to make a product that I thought you guys would love. Which I still think is a product that I think you would love. It's just been completely ruined by a decision that I didn't make. And it's so frustrating. My input in this is creative. It's coming up with new ideas. It's new like cool packaging concepts. It's new sense. It's new things we can do. And it's like testing formulations. And it's all those things. That's where I get involved in this. And I'm very heavily involved in that. And I love it. Like I'm currently on my desk in front of me. I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. About eight products that I am currently testing and making sure are right for you guys. And I don't get to talk about these things that much because I don't know. I don't know how much you'd be interested in the process of these things. But also if some of these don't go ahead, then I don't want to like talk about them in case they don't happen. And these things take years to get right. And that's all I can do. And pass that point. It's handed over. It's like a baby that's handed over to somebody else. And then they get to choose what they do with that. And I think after seeing some people's feedback on this, it's quite obvious that the decision that was made by the retailer was the wrong decision. And I'm sure that they will take that information and they will take this on board. I really hope that this has made sense to you. There's, it's a really difficult process to explain. Like there's not just like me and then like three people that like do these. There are teams and teams of people, teams that are not my teams. The licensing and the retailer and the production. There's a lot of people. You know, I don't sit at home like packing it all myself and sending it out to you. And the money comes straight into my PayPal. That's not what happens. That's not how it works. It's really complex. And there's a lot of people and there's a lot of decisions. And not all those decisions are mine to make. And the price is one of them. So I'm really sorry that so many of you felt so let down by this product. I really hope that this kind of clears that up for you. Because there's a lot of people that think I chose that price and that I don't care. And that I'm doing it for the money. And that makes me so sad. Because that's not who I am. That is not why I do this. And if you know me, you know that. So there's no point me rattling on about that. I'm not who to justify myself as a person. Because you either know me or you don't. And this is just a rubbish situation that hopefully a lot of people can learn from. That's that. I hope that's cleared that up for you. Thank you so much to all of you who support the brands and have voiced your concern in a more calm and manner. I have really, really appreciated it. So yeah, that's it for now. But thank you for listening. And I will see you again very soon. Bye."
020_Jenna,"This week for my video I posted a vlog of me going to get some fish with my boyfriend Julian And I have since taken that video down and I've seen a lot of people I did write a response on Twitter I saw why I was taking it down and there's still a lot of people that are like very confused as to what happened and I First of all, I didn't sleep when they threw Thursday because this was like It was completely just like destroyed. I was like sobbing all day on Thursday I fell asleep last night at like 8 p.m. or something and just woke up so I'm laying in bed this morning and I'm just like How can I make this a teachable moment a fixable moment where I can show people my mistakes so that people don't do it again Instead of just taking it down like I'd like to at least be Like making this into something where people can have a better idea of What to do in the future and what not to do in the future because I made a mistake and It was my fault and I feel terrible for it and I know a lot of you at least that saw the video when it was up and Even now are like this is ridiculous and I totally understand that attitude But to me it's not ridiculous and to I'm sure a lot of people that have fish as pets Don't see it as ridiculous. So I guess I just want to like say a couple things about it I think maybe at the end of this I am gonna include the video so you can see what I did and Hopefully that will be enough reason for someone to not make that mistake again instead of it just not being on the internet like I'd like to have it Be something where you can at least learn what not to do and you know why I made a mistake and you know Why other people make mistakes too some of the criticism that I had received after I got my hamster ad was that I was You know getting a pet like on an impulse on a whim and didn't know enough about them to take care of them and all that was Sort of valid except for the fact that like When I'm getting a new pet They're like my family members. So maybe I don't have all of the most perfect information up front before I get them But I am fully Ready and willing and responsible enough to know that I'm I'm going to do anything that I can While there with me that you know everything that they do in their life as a result of my effort and I'm going to take care of them to the best of my ability I'm not a person that's gonna go get a pet and then decide like oh, you know I really don't want this and then you know get rid of them or give them away and And like although the videos do seem very spontaneous of me going and getting a hamster for example I promise you that my level of Responsibility is completely there and my heart is completely there and as you saw with ad Although I didn't make like a longer follow video with ad you saw like through Julian's vlogs and my Snapchat and in the future with ad like I will do anything to make sure that you are a happy hamster and I'm sorry that I went to pet co or pets more wherever I went and you know got what was available there to me and That wasn't what was the best for him because Ed deserves the best. He's my son, you know So with the fish from learning from that experience If I'm gonna get a fish I'm going to go to the most you know wonderful fish place I'm gonna get some really good advice I'm gonna get someone that's gonna tell me everything that I need to know and you know really set this up right and make sure that That these fish are like kingfish, you know I want them to have a great life and a great time while they're in my house. It's a small locally privately owned Aquarium specific store and they have glowing online reviews About knowledgeable staff about people they know what they're talking about and I've read a couple of those reviews that were like You know, I was a beginner and I went in here and they really helped me so I thought that I was doing these fish a Service by getting them from someone that actually cared about where they were gonna go and Like yes all of this again is My fault because it's my job to be informed about the fish and where they should live and how they should live not the person selling them to me and I should have done a better job off the bat by just Maybe going in there with an idea of what a good first fish first fish for me to have was and you know Just educating myself in that level, but I didn't I went in there and I was hoping that someone could educate me a Complete beginner on fish sort of I mean as an adult a complete beginner and you know help me pick out something that was gonna be good for me and My experience with fish in the past has been you know, I come from a time in the United States where it wasn't uncommon to win a goldfish at a carnival you know and I think that's part of the hole where oh, they're just fish comes from because you know You could win a fish and then we'd go home and put them in a bowl and they might die So people are like us just a fish. Well, you know have a little fishy funeral for them But that's not the case obviously they're living beings they deserve to have a nice environment just like anybody else and I had had some successful fish when I was little they're had goldfish and You know, I was like I think I understand what it takes to have a fish and you know even if it's Far more intensive than that. I'm willing to do that because I'm an adult now and I'd like to have some fish. I think it'd be great So it wasn't my lack of wanting to have them or wanting to take care of them It was my lack of information going in so that I could preemptively make sure that they had a good place to live Fuck sake. Sorry that camera just died. So anyways, I went into a a nice specialty fish store and I was hoping they could set me up a fish appropriate for my skill level and a tank appropriate for my skill level And I was really counting on that person to help me their expertise Because you know, it's not like I had never been exposed to any fish things in the world I had in the past as a younger person and I had as an adult sort of a little bit You know like I know that I don't want a saltwater fish or a shark or Something that needs a hundred gallon tank You know, I would like something small and you know that I can take care of without being a fish expert and that if I would like to Continue to move into that hobby that I can grow and learn and you know expand my knowledge like that so I was really counting on this person to Recommend something to me rather than me going in there with a certain set of ideas about you know What I thought was good for me as a beginner. So as you'll see in the video It shows us going in there and the guy had said to I don't I don't want to disclose the place I mean maybe in the future I will if people are curious But they did really have really nice reviews and I'm not trying to blow up their spot really like I'm not trying to say you know These people did this to me You know fuck them like I don't I don't really know Some people might have a really great experience with them. Maybe they are really great I don't know but this was my experience and I'm not trying to like drag them personally But I went in and he told me to pick a tank size first and then we'll work that way in order to pick a fish That's appropriate for that and appropriate for my skill level because I was like you know I don't know anything and you know I'm new to having a fish and I need something for like a beginner and You know he explained to me the larger the tank The easier it is to clean and that you know we should get the largest tank that we can feasibly get and You know work that way so you'll see in the videos that he recommended a circular tank to me Although it looks kind of small in the video. It is eight gallons You know, it's not super tiny and a lot of people were saying to me, you know the general rule is like one gallon per fish basically or one to two Depending on what the fish are and the fish that he Told me to get where we gave me a bunch of options the ones that we decided were petra of barbs or barbs so basically they'll grow to like two or three inches maybe and So yeah, they might eventually grow out of that but you know he didn't explain that to me But in theory, yes, that was enough space for them Just based on that but I had since learned when I posted this video because it's a really cool tank There's you know LED lights and like bubbles and stuff. It's red But the circular tanks are illegal in some countries because it's seen as cruel So they basically just like swim around I think there's predators there to start their vision like it's not good for them and Obviously I would have never bought a circular tank if I had known that but you know again This is my fault for going in there and not knowing that and it also is kind of discouraging to me that We in America would even sell that as an option if it's not good for a fish and You know, I got a lot of comments from people being like I have a bio war It's really great like this is ridiculous like don't worry about it But like if there's any question like how hard is it to get a rectangle tank? Not hard for me, you know what I mean like who cares and also Again the bubble the center filtration there. I did he did get me to get a Heater in there a thermometer so that the temperature was correct and all of that But someone had told me in the comments of my video that the center bubble column It sort of ends like right here and that there was a power outage one time and he had a beta fish in there The same size as mine which is in the comments I read probably appropriate for maybe one beta fish maybe and The power went out and his beta fish swam like into there and like basically killed itself So I live in Southern California You guys have seen when we have like blackouts and stuff It's like it happens too often for me to not consider that as something to be really worried about I don't want my fish to kill themselves So like fuck no, I'd rather have something from the top where they can't just swim in there like fuck man Like come on dude fucking help me out here. I don't want my fish today We picked that tank because he had suggested to get the biggest size tank that we could but I was like You know, I'm not gonna get a 50 gallon tank like you know, I'd like something that could fit on a a tabletop and Have you know maybe I was thinking going in there. I was like get one fish and like have these thing, you know I don't know like you tell me I need some help and Do we pick that tank and There was no like you know, you should get a rectangular tank or you know, there was no discussion It was like these are probably good. It's like a whole set up for like beginners You know they got everything you need in there just get this guy and then all right over here We got some some barbs some you know he threw out Tetris or Tetris or different fish and you know all these other like walked us down and I was like here's all the fresh water fish and You know these are some good ones that you can start off with and I'm like okay and Then I was like I don't know what to put in here like is there gravel He's like it comes with gravel and then he pointed me to like the bio or he was like these are probably the nicest you know Decorations you should put in there and so he sold us on like a actual box full of all that stuff that you saw It was like okay cool and he explained to me sort of the Cycle you know that we should wait as long as we can to introduce them into the water Where is now I realize that this need to be done like a month at a time because The the fish need if you guys want to do research if you ever would like a fish I you know check out Taylor Nicole Dean who's been a blessing to me and The aftermath of this I it's really invaluable to have her opinion and thoughts It's like the mistake I made when I was younger when you would win a goldfish on a fair and you're like dad Help me set it up and you know you put them in a nice bowl and you guys Like you can't just put a fish into some water even with conditioner Even with the biological whatever because they they need it to be the pH balance the ammonia the nitrates and all this stuff needs to be right for them to live in and You know he did sort of make it sound to me that by adding these things to the water and letting it set up for a while and Adding their water and that it was gonna be okay for them and It's not It's not okay. I'm upset that I Trusted someone else's expertise. It seems silly to go into a place where you're like I believe that you're trying to help me and like Wikipedia everything that he's saying to me on my own and be like actually Get fucked but basically the the little barbs That he then recommended to go into that tank. You know, they're like their school fish They like to be in a school. They like to be with their friends and They need like a nice long like at least 30 gallon tank to swim back and forth and like have a good time with their buddies and Had I known that I would have never put them into a circular tank alone basically After I uploaded the video to where a lot of people, you know, this is their experience as well is you go into a place You have some knowledge not really obviously the best knowledge or enough knowledge, but you do have some knowledge or experience and You know, you take someone else's word and good faith and you come home and you do the best that you can and You obviously want your fish to have a wonderful environment You want to see your fish being like this is fucking great. I'm having a great time Nobody wants to see their fish be like wow this sucks. I hate my life post of the video and I started getting feedback obviously of like first first and foremost No circle tank don't do that and I'm like fuck. Okay That's something I can fix I can fix that I can get them a bigger tank. No problem second like Those plastic plants in there like that that's not good for them like they need Natural plants obviously like their natural environment. Okay, fuck all right. Let me fix that I can do that. I can work on that They'll filter obviously the person telling me the power going out and them going in there fuck Okay, let's get rid of this tank and then people, you know telling me he shouldn't have sold you those barbs You know they they need a big 30 gallon tank. They're they're gonna grow to be a couple inches They need more space than that and I'm like fuck. Okay. I'll do anything I'll do anything that it takes and then as I started to look more and more into it I realized like Basically my fish are suffering right now So because there's no established like Cycled system in there basically when they poop and pee they create ammonia and then they're supposed to be a good level of bacteria in that tank already that eats that ammonia so to fish cycle the tank You know it takes a little while for those fish to live in there and some might die which is what he was explaining to me and Like that's just part of the system but since the fish community has sort of May their way around that and have created a fishless Cycle for their tanks so that they don't have to have little fish that live in an awful environment and die in order to get your tank Ready for fish to live in it. That's one thing that I am really grateful to the fish community on YouTube and the internet as well is that instead of people giving me feedback that was making me feel like some monster for Following the directions of someone that didn't necessarily have my or the fish's best interest at heart They were normalizing my experience and genuinely trying to help me moving forward what is the best thing to do for these fish and I really appreciate that and I already felt horrible enough as it is once I realized that I had made a mistake and What doesn't help is when people are like? Fuck you for doing this your piece of shit like this was an honest mistake and I am Really sorry to the fish. I am sorry to anyone that thinks that they should do this or like I I sat with the guilt of the fact that I have a in the other room a Tankful of fish that don't deserve to be in that environment and you know I thought I was doing something fun and happy and it wasn't like For books sake it sucks. It doesn't help when someone reminds you That you're a terrible person it feels bad man So I genuinely appreciate that people were you know not only trying to help me but they were normalizing this as you know before I became a fish expert I did the same thing and I had fish die and it really sucks and it feels terrible and You know it's something that people do go through not because they want to but because sometimes this is the Information that is you know available to us and at this point with the internet. This is my fault There is no excuse. I should have done this beforehand I should have had a tank doing its thing for a month so that I can introduce some fish and a safe way This is my fault now after I uploaded the video. I did reach out to Taylor who by the way if you are looking to get a fish Her and there's a bunch of other channels solid gold aquatics is the other girl that commented on my my channel But there's like there's a really rad fish community on YouTube and I of course found them all after the fact and Taylor and Nicole Dean by the way as Everything was sort of going on. I fell down a serious cheese hole which is cheese is one of her fish and now I'm emotionally invested in cheese But I just I really appreciate That the fish community sort of was like okay Jenna, you know, he sort of fucked up But like here's what you can do now and I Did I asked Taylor a DM Taylor on Twitter? I need to know now that I've done this What is the most ethical thing for me to do at this point now that the fish are in Environment that's you know not balanced for them ready. It's not ready yet Do I leave them in there do I continue to let them sort of like Help the tank go through this natural cycle do I move them into a bigger tank and you know have them do it in there Do I give them back to the pet store because you know it's sort of unethical to leave them in that tank and Taylor gave me a couple of options. I want to just tell you From my perspective and why why I got here I ethically didn't want to leave the fish in that tank and mostly information that was you know being bestowed upon me was that you know you've changed 25% of the water every single base so that the ammonia build up in there isn't enough to like harm them and totally willing to do that no problem but it felt wrong like Those fish are basically in there with not good bacteria. It's not great. It's the wrong shape The wrong size. They're not having a good time. There's no natural plants. Bedtime Bedtime all around bad water bed fun bedtime and to move them into another tank with even more water and even more space and Not natural plants and theirs like you know I'm just asking them to do that process on an even bigger scale and now an even more stressful scale and To me the most ethical thing to do was to get them out of the environment that I had put them in Immediately and to get them back into water that was safe for them into an environment that wasn't gonna hurt them Like the plastic plants no good for them. They're gonna cut their little fins on there. No fun They don't like them. There to me there was no other option like Yes, I could go into that room and change 25% of the water every day Hoping that they're gonna live through it and hoping that everything's gonna be okay and I can cycle my tank But I just I literally could not look at them being like yeah, I hope you live. It's like no Fuck no, I want to get you out of here so that you can be in a place that's good for you I put you in a bad environment. That is my fault not yours Why should you have to suffer the consequences of my bad decision? You know what I'm saying? That's what it felt like to me So although I know some of you are probably like you know You could have fixed the tank. It's not a big deal You know just let them live but to me it's like I put my fish in a in a bad place So I'm gonna make it right and I'm gonna put him in a right place So we brought the fish back to the place that I got them and I was like you know I want to talk to the guy that Sold me these fish and told me that this was a good environment for them and told me what to do I want to tell him you know, hey man I Double checked and it turns out everything you told me it was kind of fucked and So I went in there being like it took a while to get our our fish You safely into a bag so that we could bring them back and it was really hard to like do that because I was now emotionally attached to them. I love them. I want them to be happy But knowing that I was doing something that was Ultimately right for them and gonna help them and I wasn't gonna make them suffer it through a new cycle process. They didn't deserve that so I went in there being like I'm gonna tell this guy like hey man fuck you and I went in there. I've been crying all day and I went in there and I was like I have to give these fish back to you like I don't want my money back I'm I'm not mad. I've I just I have to get back to you and I just start crying like a baby and He was like what's wrong? Can I give you credit? Like you know, and I was like These fish don't you guys sort of sold me a circle tank and you said that was okay with plastic plants And a filter that they couldn't theory get into and you guys you said that that was right and these fish You know they crying they grow to be like a couple inches and they need to be in a school And they need to swim back and forth and they need to like you know have other fish there eventually And he was like yeah, there's a lot of bad information online isn't there You know and I was like So confused because Clearly the information that people were giving me was like a resounding No circle tanks like those fish need to be in a 30 gallon tank that you they need to be in a school And that here's this guy the expert That's telling me that all of that was misinformation and I just got like really discouraged, you know like you're the person selling them when everyone else in the fish community is saying that This is what the fish need what the fuck man? What the fuck he was like they're fine. It's it was fine And I'm like no, it's not fine. I was like I just I want you to take it back I want you to put them back in the tank so you know they can be in a environment that's safe for them And where they don't they're not gonna die Because I'm stupid. It sort of just made me realize like obviously I care about fish Obviously I care about other living beings. I literally don't eat animals Like I care I care about my pets. I want them to be happy Yeah, those fish could have lived in that tank just fine and everyone that had told me that is totally right You know we can make it work so they can live in there and that's fine But in analogy, I think that helps me understand is like with my dogs or Dogs in general is like Yeah, a German shepherd could live in a one bedroom apartment and spend eight hours a day in a crate and survive But it's not right for him, you know It's not the place that he should be and if you care about that dog You you wouldn't make him do that just because you love him and you want him to like be with you, you know So I wanted to do right by those animals and This whole thing's been a really big learning experience for me obviously and That's I guess that's my biggest takeaway is that I would have loved to have provided a fish or a couple of fish A really lovely environment It's not that I'm unprepared once I get them to take care of them and do everything that it takes I had just failed them in the beginning by not having an environment ready for them and My only option After this point was to just make sure that they were in a safe environment So in the future when you're like Jenna, where's your fish? They're not here. I brought them to a place where they'd be better off and You know someday if I decide that I'm not completely scarred by this experience Because it has been kind of traumatic for me That if I would like to you know get a fish so that I would I would like to make sure That I do it the right way and that there's an environment appropriate for them before they even come in so obviously This is like it's pretty awful for me to post. It's like pretty. It's like tearing me up inside obviously I'm like I don't I don't want to put my video up But I want this to be something that maybe not only normalizes your experience or you know Prevents anyone in the future from making this mistake with fish in particular because people's attitude about fish is a lot like what that guys is is like You know whatever. Fuck it man. They'll just they're fine. They're fish whatever But to me it was like I feel terrible. I would I just want to fucking crawl in a hole and die today Like I can't believe that I Did this I feel terrible. I am gonna put the video up so you can see a step-by-step tutorial of how not to get a fish and how to set up their environment completely wrong and I'm gonna link some channels in the description that have some good information about fish some solid information about fish If you're curious about doing this and you don't want to make the same mistake that I did and and even though it it hurts me and It's embarrassing and I feel Literally fucking awful. I'm trying to make this into a positive thing and At least prevent someone else from seeing my video and being like all that circle tank school I want to go get one even if this is it my expense like I feel fucking terrible I don't think I could feel worse at this point But like I want to just make sure that no one else does that and then has to feel like that because it really sucks man and I want to say thank you to the fish community you guys are really kind and thoughtful and You made me feel like I wasn't alone that this is a common mistake and that you know sometimes people that work in these stores This is a thing that they do they sell you a fish that's going to need a bigger environment and you know They make it they set you up to fail so that your fish die and you come in with a million questions to keep buying more fish and Bigger fish and with bigger spaces. So they set you up in this like You know, they're like getting you addicted to drug space It's like yeah, I'll sell you this crack and then eventually you're good. I need a crack cave. You know what I'm saying? If there's something that you do take away from the video, I hope that you see how like Genuine I am and that like I just want some fish that have a nice place to live and then I didn't do this out of any Malice or with any intentions other than like I'd like to have some fish You know they're great. They're cool. I want them to live in my house And I am prepared to take care of them and do everything that they need but Right now I done fucked up And you know did this wrong. I hope I've done enough here to Make sure again that you know this is not what you should do And if you want to know what to do There's lots of resources Please if you ever have a friend or anybody that's like I want to get a fish make sure that you like point them in a good direction Yeah, the sucks I'm so incredibly sorry And I hope that I did enough for the the fishies to get them back into a better environment So that they did not have to site painfully cycle a tank themselves A tank that wasn't right the wrong size the wrong shape with no natural fun fucking plants in there for them Like nothing fun in there for them and in the future if I choose to do this I will gladly and happily make a video about the right way to do it So for those of you that are like this is stupid and like way too extra I apologize, but to a lot of people it's not and to me it's not and these are living breathing beings and I just want them to have a good life and I fucked up and I'm really sorry I hope that this is like enough to prevent anyone else from doing this And know that I feel really really terrible about it and That's you know that's it And it's not like with the fish it wasn't like ad where it was like Oh my god, I'll fix it right away. It was like No, they're they're gonna continue to suffer because of my bad choice And you got to make it right right now like You can't just get them a bigger tank. So I mean as much as I wanted to continue to Give the fish a bigger and better and amazing fun environment for them Like it would have required them to suffer through that and that I'm just I wouldn't be able to like go to sleep at night. Honestly. I can't Here's the video. It's a step-by-step tutorial of what not to do if you would like to get a fish Most of the video is just me being annoyed at Julian. So Take that for what it is that here is the video. This is what happened to the video I hope you understand I am incredibly sorry It did not mean to disappoint anybody or make anyone mad or do wrong by any animals. So again I really apologize and I hope that if you're looking into getting some fishies just don't do what I did just don't do don't do it Here you go. I will see you next week. Okay, bye I Order What are you doing? Yes, what? I want I didn't even say it. I want to get some fishies Why are you laughing? What kind of fish? I don't know just like a maybe like a nothing no salt water Maybe there's like a fresh water guy that like it'll be easy and little one. I don't know see I don't know that much about fish. I haven't had one since I was younger I had two goldfish But then one of them like ate the other one what happens when it does why are you thinking that for? I don't know what can go I forget to feed ads sometimes. I'm good at everything. I know and I'm gonna need help if we're gonna get more animals Well, we feed them at the same time as ad just a little sprinkle here fish photo Well, sprinkle ads seeds and nuts somewhere where if there's an earthquake he's gonna be okay Let's see if it's fine really you don't seem excited I'm excited. Don't I look excited? No, that doesn't look like the face of excited. No, let's get a fish Will you name him or do I get to know him? That's the compromise you can name him No one's gonna want to dogs it anymore because they have to feed a zoo. It's not a zoo Is this my sanctuary? This was your reaction when I asked for ad and now he's like your actual best friend in the world You heard it. We're going to get a new friend listen, okay? Hear me out. I know a lot of you are like Jenna you have so many animals You can't just keep acquiring animals. I woke up today wanting to do one of two things I either wanted to absolutely decorate the shit out of my house with Christmas decorations and even I recognized my too much Jean and was like Thanksgiving hasn't even happened yet. It's it's not okay or acquire a new friend for our family I know we joke about my age all the time that I'm like 31 and have a basketball game tomorrow Which is all very true also a burgo. I'm also never wrong But like I feel like I'm at the age where all I want to do is just mother something to death And I read a comment recently and on one of our hamster videos that was like I can't wait to see what animal Jenna gets next so she can mother it to death Which is so completely true, but I'm I'm really like Julian I do want to have kids but like we need a couple of things before we get there Well, I just need to mother something to death. It's like overwhelming So I was like what kind of pet can we get because you know even a mammal is probably too much even a bird is probably too much I'm being realistic here. We could get a little fishy guy I asked Julian for a cat just about every day and Julian says no So I feel like a fish is a good compliment Yeah, but it is I can't have plants though. I'll die I never I'd like that's when my mothering too much gene is like too much I either just like drench them and drown them or the dead. We're gonna get a fishy guy. I don't know what kind 31 and I need something that's at least gonna survive through my basketball game tomorrow All those fails we're coming home to the far out So my choices are like side Yeah, I heard you play pub G Well, that guy's a big one. What's your favorite subreddit your tank when you buy it? You're tanking one week. Can you get me a free life on HQ? Please do you play HQ? Oh, I like him. I like him a lot. You look like ad like they make I know these guys are like really connecting with me right now. I'm like so many love it. How are you, Trent? So we picked a small like round One more time. Like start on Don't one what a tank Or it comes with gravel And then he recognizes on his like little fish that we can go to start and establish an ecosystem And then he's a big big fish and we have not picked out the fish We're gonna get a little school Penta barbs he said five or six This is the one we're getting Penta barp So they keep coming in from all the bar. Yeah, they're like hanging out in little school and they're good like starter fish to make it go So we're not gonna miss their friends I marked the one you don't need to use with an X You like them? Yeah I got a bad one fish for it's gun dark. Okay. We had a lot of learning to do But that guy was so helpful. Hey, he was really really really helpful He made sure that we got fishies that were good to like establish an ecosystem in there and like We're gonna fight each other. We got five right not six five five Tetra barbs is that what they're called? Tetra bars named after barbs from the same thing. We got five barbs y'all This is some real justice for barb. They're all named barb So we're gonna take them home. They're gonna have a lot of time to chill out while we get their tank ready So that we make sure we have the the right setup for them and Julian will name them all are you excited? All name them all. Yeah, they look. I'm so excited I think it's gonna be such a nice little addition to our family. All right, let's get them on. Okay We're gonna set up the tank that I wanted the doggies to say hello to the no bars Karma's very curious. He just jumped on the table and almost stepped on their bag This is like a nice solid surface. Yeah, if there's an earthquake What we don't want is that Tetra bobs to go fly. I know you have to wash everything look at this terrifying picture Do not place in direct sunlight because it can concentrated light rays can cause a fire. I like barbs But I also don't want to catch an on fire very informative to my aries partner Julian disconnect the power before you ever reach into the water. Okay Julian never carry or pull the unit by the electrical cable. Are you listening? Julian we got this really nice selection of things since their freshwater fish We chose a nice little fresh water a selection of things except for this one Except for this because Julian insisted on getting this does that have a name? Yeah, okay We don't want to ask you like Carl. Let's spell it's coral Julian You excited Turn that way what is that another rock Julian you have to bury that big ball. Julian you're smushin don't aries this up. Okay, I kind of want to live in there Stop being nasty their heater and their thermometer back there I cannot get this fucking ball to stay down. Oh my god We're gonna do a half a cap of that so that it gets nice and ready We're gonna make sure the temperature is good do some biological booster to add some bacterial cultures in there That's all for that stupid ball Remember give up on the ball on the good fish parents. Feel the boost you Well, I think we did it. This is fucking amazing. I want it to be red Now I want it to be green now. I want it to be blue the statue isn't centered. It's turned. Oh my god My boy go do not unplug it just so you can straighten the statue. Oh, butter So we're gonna let this run for a little while make sure it's the right temperature We'll see you in a little while here at the barbs They're so cute. They've put in their water a bunch. They've just been hanging out Trying to get your water in here with the new water so you can start to feel look at their like let us out already So we're gonna aquane and just kind of like stay still for a while Yeah, Bob So this has been going for quite a while now the guy at the fish store did say to let it cycle for 24 hours And I was like is it possible to do it at all today? And he said yeah, but there is a chance that you know, they're not gonna acclimate well And they might die but that they might also do that after 24 hours because they're new fish and a new tank So I mean, I'm a little concerned because the want the bars to live certainly doesn't mean 24 hours But like we've been having the tank go for quite some time I should put a little bit of the tank water in with their water. This seems so extra just what I'm in no They'll die either way. He did prepare me but anytime you're starting a new tank some fish might die So I'm really pulling for all of our barbs and we're trying our best here So a little at a time. We'll do a little more and a little bit Please if you're on the internet and you're a fish care elitist know that I have not had a fish And so I was a child and I'm trying my best just like with ad like if I make some mistakes in the comments You can try and help me understand But know that I want the best for my fish. I really do. I'm not trying to do anything wrong But if I do don't yell at me okay. I have a lot of things some other pitch up. Do you want to see the fishies?

021_Shay," Okay. I've been wanting to make this video for a long time and I have really lacked the courage. I've been terrified. I was so ashamed. I embarrassed. I disgusted. I just scared. I want to apologize. I want to say I was sorry to my wife. My kids, my family, I want to say sorry to all of you. A lot of people say I don't owe anybody an apology. What I do. And I want to take responsibility for my actions, for the choices that I made, that brought pain and embarrassment and shame to me and my loved ones. Not because I have an alcoholism problem, not just to find anything I did or said. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I don't know if God's forgiven me. I don't even think my wife's been able to forgive me yet. But I have to forgive myself. Or I will destroy myself. I hate myself for the pain that I caused my angel of a wife, the embarrassment, the public humiliation. I'm tired of hiding from it. I'm tired of feeling like this. I'm not saying I don't deserve it. You know what I'm saying? I wasn't wrong. I take full responsibility. I fell to my, the natural man, the carnal, sensual and devilish part of me that exists, that I have to fight against every day, the path of least resistance, this tilts towards the T-lestual that constantly nags at my soul and pulls me to something in some place I don't want to be. I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect. I've never said I was perfect. I've fought to stay happy. I still believe that happiness is a choice. I believe that my choices have caused me much unhappiness. And if I will just choose better, I will find joy through good choices. I believe in families. I believe my family is the most important thing in the world to me. I don't care about YouTube. I don't care about fame or money. I don't care about scalable businesses. I care about my wife and kids. To me, we are eternal. And the things that matter the most last longest. And I believe that families are forever. That is my biggest hope. That is the one thing that I care about. It's that I can exist with them after this body dies. After we exit this earth, whatever this mortal test is after that is over, I don't want our relationships to expire. I want to be with my wife forever. And I don't know if that's true, but it is my biggest hope. It is the thing that I want more than anything in this world. And that's what I'm going to focus on. I'm going to focus on strengthening my family. I'm going to focus on families in general. My... I just want to apologize and take full responsibility for the things that I said to somebody that I did not deserve to be saying most things to. I want to apologize to my wife and my kids and my family and friends who also had to stick up for me and endure the embarrassment of my choices. There's a million things I can say. And I don't know what the right thing is. But these are the things that I know for sure. I'm sorry. I take full responsibility and I love my family more than anything else. And I don't know what the future holds. I don't have a big comeback planned. I don't have a big idea or a web series. I don't expect any of you to forgive me. I just want to start fresh and not feel like a scum. And I felt that I've deserved to and I have allowed myself to suffer. And I'm not... I just want to say thank you for listening. And I can do better. And I'm not going to have to go as far as I can. I'm not going to see you know the rule but I will have to prove myself over time to the gamey battle to overcome the worst parts of the world. I won't go."
022_Logan," I've made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgment and I don't expect to be forgiven. I'm simply here to apologize. So what we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned. And the reactions you saw on tape were raw. They were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologize to the internet. I want to apologize to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness or depression or suicide. But most importantly, I want to apologize to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. They do not deserve to be defended. The goal with my consent is always to entertain, to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world I live and I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel or malicious. Like I said, I made a huge mistake. I don't expect to be forgiven. I'm just here to apologize. I'm ashamed of myself. I'm disappointed of myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you."
023_Dufner,"Now for the people still watching, it's time for you to be creative. What if I did go missing by the killer? He kidnapped me, took my clothes, and murdered someone to make it look like he murdered me. But it's whole time he was holding me hostage waiting for the cops to come to set me up under the mask. And now that killer is running free right now and plotting his next move. Be creative. Be open-minded. Allow yourself to make the movies your mind creates. So, I didn't want to make this video at all, but it's kind of a necessity. And everybody watching this right now, before this video, before I even start talking, because I mean I tried to make this video like 14 times of it doing this all day. But there's just so much to say and so much to talk about, so much to explain. And my mind just goes too crazy to be able to get everything on the table without like going off on tangents or completely messing up my words. So, fair with me. This may be a long video, but if you are watching this, I want you all. Every single one of you that are watching this right now. Whether you're a huge fan of me, whether you hate my guts, whatever you are, just I need every single one of you before this video starts to do me a huge favor. And take your bias-ness and wipe it clean. I want every single buddy that's watching this right now to be completely open-minded. And not have opinions until you hear everything that I have to say. Because... It's just this went so spiral out of control and I need to explain myself and there's a lot of different points to be explaining. And I'm completely open-minded. I understand if you're a fan and you're upset with me, if you're mad at me, and you're a fan, if you're like, ah, you put the heck, you know blah blah blah, you that's messed up. Don't do that. I understand that. I understand those comments. But let me explain what happened. I can explain all this, but it's just super-hocomy of you. So, just watch the whole video and you won't be as ignorant because I'm getting a lot of ignorant comments that don't even know what they're talking about. Because what happened was when I first started uploading this series, yes series guys, I don't... Okay, I am the fur... That is the furthest thing away from prank. People are saying prank? furthest thing away from it. It is not a prank. It was nowhere ever intended to be a prank. So get the word prank and throw it or flick it as far as you possibly could. Because this, all of this was not a prank and it was not me faking my death. That wasn't it at all. And what happened was after that video that I posted, it's called He's Dead. I will link everything to the underneath the description. Or you can just go to my channel and check it out. But it was titled He's Dead. And pretty much my series was... There was a stalker, crazy fan, and more of the story is I went to go meet him and he slaughtered me on camera. And 50% of my fans thought, bro, this was so awesome, bro. This video was so sick, Jake, you're a legend. This is so creative, this is so entertaining, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's 50% of the comments. And the other 50% were like, you know, the innocent little fans that are just like, oh, I hope you're okay, blah, blah, blah. And then there was like that, that like 2% of people that saw that video that just took it completely out of control. You know, that we're making reaction videos on it, like Jake Duffner's dead, this, that, and every single time I saw a video being uploaded, talking about me being dead, I cringed so hard. I was like, why? Why is this happening? And not that like, you know, it's their fault for making that video because I know it's something crazy that happened. And if you do think that, you know, I'm dead, then of course you're gonna make a reaction video, like a YouTuber just died. But, ah, oh man. Just bear with me because it's getting, it's gonna get deep. And pretty much people were coming to my channel to only see that video. They're not, they didn't, they don't understand what's going on. They don't, okay, it was like a 10 video series. I uploaded like 10 videos in one week and they only seen that one video. So, I mean, I understand where you're coming from. Trust me, I'm being completely open minded just like you guys watching this are going to be as open minded as possible. I understand where you're coming from. If you came to my channel and you saw that video, and that's the only video you saw, then I understand why you can be like, oh my god, Jake Duffner's dead and make a video about it. Or go on Instagram and be like, yo, rest in peace, Jake Duffner, this, that I understand that. And then, after a few hours go by, I guess people brought it over to me. I wanted over to other social media, not just YouTube. And I mean, I do that all the time. You guys know that if you're a fan of me and you've been watching me for this amount of time, then you know that I always kind of interact Instagram and YouTube together because it allows me to be closer with you guys and explain what's going on. And you know, just talk to you guys, interacting with you guys. So, I'm always like going back to forth on Instagram and YouTube. So, I understand people coming over my Instagram. But then what started happening was people were putting my death on Instagram. People that, you know, are completely irrelevant to the whole situation. And then I was getting flooded on my Instagram of people like, oh my god, rest in peace. And then people that don't even know who I am were coming to my page. And seeing that everybody was saying rest in peace. And then they were like, why are they saying that? And then they would see the video and only that video. And they'd be like, wow, this kid's a scumbag. He's faking his death for publicity. And that is not what I did. I did not fake my death for publicity. Even though I understand once again, where you guys are coming from. And once again, I'm being open-minded. I understand where those people are coming from. Like, wow, this kid's a scumbag. He's faking his death for publicity. Because you saw someone posting on Instagram, rest in peace, Jake Duffner. And then you went to go do more research and found that video. And you're like, wow, this video is entertaining. But it's a complete lie. And it's not a lie, first of all. It's not fake. It's not a lie. It's not a prank. Get all three of those words and shove them so far into the nearest person to your left's ass. Because that's not what it is. It is not a prank. It is not fake. And what it is is simply acting. It's acting. It is being creative. And if you want to be on YouTube, if you're scrolling through YouTube and you don't want entertaining videos, if you don't want someone that is putting hard work into their videos, then this is not the channel for you. Because I have 400,000 Duffies, 400,000 fans that that joined my journey just because of my personality, just because I was funny and outgoing. And I love you guys so much. Like that honestly blows my mind that I'm at 400,000 subscribers of just me and my friends joking around messing around. And that's amazing. Like I could have kept going. I could have just been I was growing slowly. I could have kept doing that. And I could have been like, you know, this is awesome. People are loving me from my personality. But one thing that you guys never knew of me. And that I wanted to show very badly was that I am one of the most creative people that most people have met. When I was growing up, I remember being like 10, 11, 12 years old. And I remember just in every day life, I would I would do things here and there that I don't know how to explain it. Maybe I'll give an example. Okay, one time I was like 10, 11 years old once again. And I was in the bathtub or I was in the shower. I don't know why I said that's up. And the door was open. And I knew that my brother was out there talking to my mom or doing something and in the hallway where you can see into my into the door. You can't see into the shower, but you can see like, you know, the showers right behind the wall and there's a door. So you see if I'm coming in and out of the shower, but you don't see me in the shower. And I knew it was out there. So what I did was I slipped on purpose and fell out of the shower. And I didn't make myself seem like, I have a concussion or anything. I kind of just fell and got up and I was like, whoops. And I helped back in the shower. And my brother was cracking you up. He said it was the funniest thing. He's ever seen in his entire life. And then when I told him like, hey, I did it on purpose. Like I did that just to make you laugh. And it was a complete lie. Like I did it on purpose. Didn't believe me at all. He was like, yeah, okay, bro. That that was you fell out of your shower. I guess moral of that story is that when I do things and then people, it just gave me some type of satisfaction. I don't know. It gave me some size, but some type of satisfaction. I was creative enough and I acted well enough to make him believe that that just happened. And my whole life growing up, my friends would tell me, bro, you have a mind that can literally make movies. Like people would tell me Joe Aaron every single like every one of my friends would tell me, bro, you need to be in a studio directing movies because like your mind, no one else is thinking of that stuff. And the fact that you know, other people might think of the stuff that I'm thinking of, but they won't be able to execute it. You know, like they would just be like, oh, imagine this happened. And I'd be like, oh, that'd be crazy. But me, I will imagine something and I will make it logical to make it as if it will actually happen. Like the most insane thing you can possibly think of, I will make it down into steps and I will make it logical. And that's kind of like what I wanted to do. I have 400,000 subscribers that loved me for who I am and I think that it was time for me to show who I could be. And it was not a prank. I don't want any of you guys to think that, you know, I was pranking the subscribers because that is not what I was doing. It was not a prank. I'm seeing so many people say, you know, this is a messed up prank. I still love you though, but it was a messed up prank. So say sorry. And I guess it's a video of me saying sorry if you thought it was a prank, but it was more of a video of me explaining myself of, you know, what was going on because people took it in the complete wrong way. And I mean, people are like, you're faking your death for views because you can't do anything else. Well, that is probably one of the most ignorant comments that someone can write down below is like, you know, you're faking your death for views. You're shooting YouTuber. You're not creative because you had a fake your death reviews. It doesn't make sense to me because obviously I was creative enough to make you believe that I just faked my death. So I mean, you kind of just like twisted your own words there and ate your own words, but I don't know if you want boring vlogs. Okay, so every YouTuber right now is riding a wave. If you're at a million subscribers, two million subscribers, whatever you're at, I don't know. And I'm not hating once again on being very open-minded. The riding waves, they'd see something do well. This is what YouTubers do. They see something do well on the explore page or recommended page and they're like, wow, this person did pretty good on it. Let me kind of do the same thing only in my perspective. And that's what every YouTuber does. And literally if you click on a video, then the recommended will be 700 videos of the same exact thing, but a different creator posting it. Am I wrong? No, I'm not wrong. That's what happens. Just like on, you know, the video that I posted, there's like a million videos underneath it about Jake Duff, just dead. So what I'm saying is I don't want to... I don't want to flood YouTube with stuff that people are already seeing. You can't get this entertainment, this creativeness, anywhere else, and I'm assured of it. Yes, people are creative. I'm not saying you guys aren't creative, but people don't have the balls enough or don't have the work ethic enough. And I can say you don't have work ethic because that's not an insult. That's, you know, maybe a reality check. Like, you know, work for what you have. You have whatever a million, two million, three million, four million, five million subscribers, and you're just, you know, riding waves. And you're going to max out because you can only get to so many people until people are realize like, hey, you're just like doing the same exact thing everybody else is doing. And I want to separate myself, my channel, from all of that. I want to be known for me, my creativeness. I want to be known as the kid that no one else can do it like, you know? And once again, it wasn't me faking my death. It wasn't me pranking my subscribers. It was simply me making a series and being creative enough to where you guys would be glued to the screen that you're watching. I wanted you guys to be glued. And I've been thinking about doing crazy stuff like this for a while now. And to the fact that you guys think that I was already created for the ones that do think, yo, you're a legend for this. This was nuts. You guys don't even understand a fraction of this brain up here. I had, I had months of videos planned out of what was going to happen. And I was going to make them happen. It was going to go way more in depth, way more into a storyline. It was going to be, it was going to be crazy. Like literally nuts, something that you would see in movies. And I couldn't go any further because once again, it spiraled out of control and it went on to other social media, people thinking I was actually dead and or faking my death. So I had a bunch of fans saying, you know, this is messed up or that they're going to hurt themselves. And once I started hearing that, that people are going to hurt themselves over me and that they're crying over me and this that I was like, damn, I can't go any further with this series because I can't risk any of my fans hurting themselves over it. So I started uploading like two videos in one day, like multiple times. I was uploading as fast as possible because I couldn't just go out and tweet. Guys, don't listen. I couldn't tweet that or just say it on a video because you guys would not understand at all. And this was like the only logical way I can think of explaining it for you guys. I had to rush a finale as fast as possible. That wasn't the finale that I originally planned. Once again, I had a million videos planned up that was going to go way into more depth. And it was going to be super, super, super entertaining for you guys. And the finale was going to be mind blowing. It would have blew everyone's mind, but the fact that it spiled out of control. I was forced to upload, you know, two times the one day and rush videos and get it done as quick as possible because I didn't want people to do it. I want people to take actions into their own own hands. And I'm super, super proud that you guys look up to me. And that means the absolute world to me. My fans mean more to me than anything in my entire life. And I say that staring right into your guys eyes and I mean it from the bottom of my heart. You guys mean the absolute world to me. If I didn't have all the fans that I have, I would be nothing. And I would have nowhere to put my creative mind to. You guys are my audience. And I love you for that. You took it the wrong way and I'm sorry for that. And I just had a rush of serious. So if you guys thought this was entertaining at all, you have no idea what is going to come. And maybe I have to like, you know, for the people that are watching this still, maybe I have to like, think of like a code word to say in a video for you guys to understand like, don't be alarmed. Maybe I got to say like, shish kabab or something like that in a video. I don't know. Well, think it's something. But those are for my fans, but you know, for the outside people that come in, you have no idea what I'm talking about. And you'll be just as mind blown as all the other new people that are coming in. So. I mean, there's YouTubers already already doing boring vlogs. If you want to see boring vlogs, go to, you know, Casey Neistat, Tanner Fox, just vlog their day. And I'm not hating once again. That's your style. I love it. It's a work grind. You're doing it. If you want to see kid stuff, guava juices are already doing baby kid stuff and other people are doing baby's kid stuff. There is no other YouTuber doing it the way I'm doing it. And I just want to make that clear that all this kind of just went spout out of control. I do not fake my death. And the people that are in the comments saying, fake fake fake fake fake fake. It is literally like nats. It is so annoying saying fake fake fake fake fake. It is not fake. You guys remind me of like a person that will walk into a movie theater, sit down and watch Transformers and stand up in the middle of the movie and say, there's no way this can happen. This is fake and start yelling to all the audience that's watching the movie. And the rest of the audience like, fuck you. Shut the fuck up. I'm trying to watch the movie. It's a movie. You know, and you kind of just look stupid by saying, fake fake fake fake. But I understand that, you know, if you're not open-minded and you didn't even get through this part of the video, then I'm probably still going to go down there and comment that. But people that are watching this and are open-minded enough to watch do it and listen to me before you bade your assumptions and opinions. Then thank you so much. I'm glad you understand now. And I know there's probably so much more I have to say, like so much more I have to say once again, this is the 1 millionth time I filmed this video. And I would end the video and then I would walk away like damn I didn't say everything I needed to say because there's so much to get off my chest. Obviously I'm going to be vlogging. I'm going to be myself still. I know a lot of people are concerned like, hey Jake, I know you're making this insane content that you can't find anywhere else on the internet. But are you still going to be funny and be yourself? Of course, obviously most of my vlogs are me and my friends messing around doing reckless things. That is still going to be an everyday thing. But if something were to happen, just remember guys, I'm an entertainer and I'm doing my job because you guys know obviously I make money doing this. Obviously that's not, you know, hidden. But I take my job seriously. I am an entertainer and to me walking around vlogging, it's just not entertaining. That's not my style and I want to be able to put myself far away from those people that are taking you to as a joke where they'll vlog them tying a shoe and then going to a warehouse of merch or something. That's just not my style. My job is to make you guys glue to the screen, be entertained and blow your fucking mind. And I know for a fact that my mind can blow your mind. If you thought this was somewhat entertaining, it broke the internet kind of sort of the way it did. You guys don't even understand what was about to happen if I didn't have to end the series. You guys wouldn't even be able to wrap your head around it. And once again, even though I am kind of the creative one behind all this, I could not do this without any of this. I could not do this without any of my friends. All my friends that helped me are like, thank you so much. I, you know, Joe's driving around me everywhere, helping me staying out till 3am. It's helped me film a video then the people like Chris, my friend Chris Kyle, he's helped me with all these supplies. He's got all the stuff for me and he's being like behind the scenes of like the guy who got killed because that was him that got thrown in the lake. There's so much more behind it than you guys understand the editing process, the thought process, filming it, getting into the clips done and making it seem as if it's all one clip. It's just so much and I hope that you guys can appreciate the amount of work that I'm putting into it rather than you being closed mind and ignorant being like, oh my god. But there's so much work so thank you to all my friends. My friends are even though I have the creative mind, I couldn't do it without them. I couldn't do it by myself. So maybe it's everything I have to say. Oh, also, you guys cared so much about me that there was four state police officers at my door saying they got hundreds of phone calls. So I love you guys for that. And that's on video to about the police officers. So yeah, maybe I'll upload that to come or something like that and glad I inspire you guys. There will be maybe I'll make merch every okay. Here's a deal. I will make a t-shirt right now. It'll be first link in the description. It'll be a t-shirt that says create on it. Create because I want to inspire you guys to create and use your creative minds because every single person that's watching this right now has a creative mind, but they're too scared to embrace it and they're too scared to let it let it wander and go where it wants. I'm sure that says create on it and what it's going to do every single piece of profit that goes that is not going to go into my pockets. It's going to go into me creating crazier videos that will blow your guys mind and me being able to, you know, put more money into my videos to create for you guys. Either that or the second option is I will donate it to a charity that is your guys choice. I will do a single one that buys the merch that says create on it right now in the first link in the description will either go towards a nonprofit organization charity or it will go into my videos being way more creative than I already am. Okay. I love you guys to death. If you watched the end of the video, comment, create down down below and I love you guys to death. There's probably more I have to say, but it's not I can't thank you there right now. You guys will hear from me soon. Make sure to hit that subscribe button and be ready for a fucking journey because no one else is doing it the way I am. Now for the people still watching, it's time for you to be creative. What if I did go missing by the killer he kidnapped me took my clothes and murdered someone to make it look like he murdered me. But it's whole time he was holding me hostage waiting for the cops to come to set me up under the mask and now that killer is running free right now and plotting his next his next move. Be creative. Be open-minded. Allow yourself to make the movies your mind creates."
024_Alfie,"A couple of days ago I uploaded a video called Living on One Pound for 24 hours. I have no idea how, but at the time of filming the video, if you've watched the 36 minute video, which I've now decided to take down and I wanted to take down earlier on than what I did, but I didn't want to take it down without having this video go up because I didn't want people to think that I'm trying to just like hide it away, you kind of think? Like I fully am here, taking the hit, saying of course I messed up really, really bad and I wanted this video to go out at the same time that I did the video down because I don't want anybody to try and think that I'm avoiding this situation. This is a very, very big deal and I've made a massive mistake here. When I made the video, I genuinely, as you can see from watching it, I didn't think about charity. Like I don't know how, looking back at it, I have no idea how I didn't think about it, but I just simply saw this as, and this is where people have been calling me ignorant and stuff, and I'm not, I fully get that. Like I 100% get, I get how that came across like that. Like at one point in the video, I'm holding one pound up and I'm saying that this is all I got to spend today. That's fucking ridiculous. When I was filming there, I simply saw it as like another YouTube challenge. Like today I'm going to try and live spending only one pound. Of course looking back now, that's not a challenge. That is not something that should be on YouTube. Of course this doesn't amend anything that I've said or done in the video, but I 100% just like every other video that I mention charity in. I always donate the earners to charity. So 100% of the profits from that video will be donated to charity. I've already been on the phone to a charity in Brighton this morning, seeing how I can help them out with donating the revenue from that video. So I 100% do not want to earn obviously any money from that video, but that's not me trying to make some big charitable donation to try and hide the fact and that I messed up. Like no, that's not what was happening here. One thing that I've seen quite a lot online that I think is really unfair is people crossing that video of mine as like YouTube and YouTubers. I've seen a lot of tweets from people being like, see this is why YouTubers blah blah blah and YouTubers this and I just want to put it out there and say no, you cannot group the entire YouTube community and all of the amazing stuff that that is done and that is brought into people's lives and start throwing when there's like a fucking stupid video like the one that I uploaded a couple of days ago. You cannot start saying this is why YouTube is bad. YouTube and the community like the community that of YouTubers out there, yeah, that community is so accepting and loving and like there are so many people doing amazing stuff like unbelievable stuff on YouTube. So I just want to reiterate that when somebody does something stupid online and does like really does something super insensitive like the video I uploaded, please do not categorize that as this is what YouTubers do. Like no, that's not no. I also want to thank everybody like truly thank you to those who constructively told me that my video is wrong whether that was tweeting me emailing me. I want to thank you guys because it's people like you that are helping shaping social media like there is so much shit out there online so much bad stuff and it's people who constructively guide people that are messing up and have done stupid shit and take their time like I appreciate your time educating me why my video is wrong and that might be a bit of a weird one to say but I'm genuinely thankful for everybody and there's been a lot of people that have spent a lot of time writing messages and their notes about how their friends or family or themselves have had incredibly hard times with money and how insensitive my video was in relation to them in their lives and that really really like opened my eyes to like holy shit. Yeah my video my video is should not be on YouTube. I've been making YouTube videos now for I mean next month it's going to be 10 years. I've made over 2000 videos on this site and I should just know better like there's no excuse I should just know better than making content like this and I just want to apologise to everybody that the video has affected because like I said I was just stupid like I did not it doesn't I'm not excusing anything I'm taking full hit my fault incredibly stupid incredibly just didn't think about it which is such a shame to think that I uploaded a video to a YouTube channel of mine and I tweeted it and I Instagrammed about it to I don't know 10 million people with a piece of content that I didn't properly think about before I uploaded like I only thought about it as like this sounds like a fun video and I did so many stupid things in that video and I said so many things that at the time like for example at one point I said oh in the I I can't where I work out it has like a big water machine and I can't use that water and I'm going to have to have tap water instead and people have taken that as I now don't drink tap water which I for sure do but I I understand how fucking stupid I looked in that video or when I was talking about not been able to have my morning coffee for me at the time I just saw that as I'm opening my eyes up to where I'm spending money and where me as out of the days in the future I should be being cautious of where I'm spending my money for example a coffee every morning for example every month where I work out I have like a three pound fifty big thing of water delivered and how I should appreciate those things more in my life but it for sure did not come across like that and I can see that now and it came across completely differently and I apologize like genuinely very very sorry and I've just made myself look like a complete twat and I'm not looking for I'm not looking for any comments below that are oh I feel I forgive you like and I'm not looking for any of that I just want to voice how I'm feeling right now I owe you guys better content I owe myself better content as I said the videos now been deleted and taken off of YouTube all of the earnings from that video I'm in the process of sorting out I'm finding out the best place to donate that money whether that's a homeless shelter whether that's a charity that helps people who live in below the poverty line whatever that may be I'm finding the best charity for that money and I'm going to be donated now because I do not want to be earning any money off of that video I've also decided obviously as you can see to tell the ad sense off of this video because I don't want to be earning any money from this video something that I saw floating around on Twitter yesterday was the amount of people that were calling me a Tory and I just wanted 100% clear up right now that I'm not a Tory this satan this even sounds like stupid for me saying this coming out of my own mouth but the amount of tweets yesterday from people calling me a Tory I feel like I just need to say in this video right now that is for sure not the case I just want to apologise again to everybody I owe you guys better for sure and maybe have a lovely day whatever you're doing"
025_Tana,"Hi guys, it's Tanemoujo. Welcome to my channel or welcome back to my channel. Um, that's weird. I have now been off of social media for over a month now, which is the longest break I have taken in over three years and it's been crazy. It's been a crazy past month. And when Shane uploaded his documentary, I feel like everyone thought that it was over and that I was just being silent, you know, to be an asshole or because I didn't care or whatever, but that I was just out partying or whatever. Every single day since Tanekon, I have found out so much horrible shit. And when I say horrible shit, I mean, when I look at Tanekon, the things that I found out, they make Tanekon look like a lemonade stand, you know, a walk in the park. I found out so many horrible things about so many horrible people and I sat with so many people in this industry, people my age, people with millions of followers, people who are managed by the same people that hurt me and did me dirty and found out and got to hear the stories of sexual assault and rape and being drugged and being embezzled, tens of thousands of dollars and being fucked over and lied to 10 times harder than I could ever be. And I realize when I say this to you that those are very, very serious allegations and a very serious way to start out this video, but they're all true. And because of everything that happened with Tanekon, I have spent the last two months on what everyone thinks is a hiatus, but I've been finding out the horrible dark side of this industry. And I was originally going to make an entire documentary about it, not only what happened at Tanekon, but everything I found out, along with proof and along with interviews from all those people and stories and footage from so many of your favorite influencers who have been done so dirty and just couldn't talk about it. And I ended up tweeting about it and Shane and I were at dinner with everyone, you know, all of his friends and people from Tanekon and all that kind of stuff and we were looking at the responses and everyone was just like, it's not the time for a documentary. And a lot of people were also telling me that if I come onto this video talking about Tanekon and then I'm like, oh by the way, here are all these horrible things that everyone else has done. It's going to look like I'm pandering and I'm distracting people from what I'm really talking about. And it's just not the right time and it's so hard for me and that's why it's taken me so long to figure out what I want this video to be. Because as soon as I spent an entire two months making a whole last film, Shane and I saw that that's and talked about, you know, that that's not what people want and I'm not going to put it out in a time that I don't feel is right because it's such heavy shit. And everything that has happened has been the worst experience of my entire life. But I do believe that everything happens for a reason and I was put in those situations to eventually be the voice for and help those people who have gone through all of those horrible, unspeakable things. And if everything that happened with Tanekon never happened, I would have never been put in those situations that I would have never met those people and I would have never realized how important it is. Truly for me to use this space, this camera, this what I started with to spread a message and actually talk about what matters and that is what I will be dedicating my time to in the future. So yeah, I haven't been just fucking off and not posting anything and I know so many people are going to come to say that this is so late and why even do it and Shane already covered it and whatever and the bottom line is is everyone else has gotten to speak for me and I've yet to be able to tell this story from start to finish from my perspective. I didn't feel comfortable doing it or uploading it or making that even my main focus until all refunds were issued and so now I consider today the morning of this video being uploaded, letting you know that almost every single I'm talking like 99% of Tanekon refunds have been issued and I am so grateful for that and I know a lot of people don't want to sit through a 40 minute video of me repeating myself with some cool ass montages over it and some never before seen footage and Shane interviewed all I got to say some people just want answers and before getting into the video, to sum it all up to give the people who don't want to sit through everything the fluff. I'm an idiot and I trusted a 20 year old idiot who allusioned to me that it would be the best Tanekon in the world and to everyone saying that I didn't work, I spent every single day, I became living breathing robot Tanekon but it just wasn't enough time and where I went wrong was going into this with spite and going into this with ego and doing it in two months, I should have done it with people that I trusted and people that weren't hated in the industry and people that weren't lying to me. I shouldn't have believed the lies with rose colored glasses because I wanted the fantasy to become a reality and I shouldn't have done it with any ounce of spite towards VidCon no matter how much they wronged me and I put my fans at stake, I put my reputation at stake, I put my life and everything that I love more than anything in the world at stake because I believed in it but to be frank that wasn't enough to everyone that believed in me whether you came and you got a sunburn and you waited in line for hours and hours and hours or you are simply watching along this journey and you believed in me that I let you down and I'm sorry and I will spend the rest of my life trying to make it better to everyone asking me about capacity and security because I feel like those are the number one questions and I want to answer them before you even watch this video. 5,000 tickets were sold or given away for Tanikon. I was told that 4,000 of those tickets will be free and 1,000 of them would be sold to cover costs of the event and clearly by any footage if you've seen anything that is not what happened and that's what this video is about is uncovering all of the lies I was told that was by far one of the biggest which I think fucked over the entire event. There's been a lot of verbiage about the capacity of Tanikon only being able to support 1,000 and that is not true. The actual capacity which included far more than the ballroom was 3,192 so that still means that the event was oversold and I was wrong forever ever condoning that but I was under the impression by the company that put on the event good times in my goal that people would be shuffling in and out and going through hallways and using different rooms and spaces in the event center and that everything would be safe and fine for that amount of people and for everyone saying that I didn't research that or do anything about that I spoke to the security team tens of tens of tens of times. I looked at the background checks I spoke to the Mary-Ot employees. I asked every question that you have asked 10,000 times over and I was just as dumbfounded as you were the day of Tanikon to see what actually happened. I was told that even if all 5,000 people did show up it would be a tight fit but it would still fit and I toured the venue but I was 19 and didn't know shit about that side of things you know. If someone who runs conventions tells you yo this space fits 5,000 people and you ask a thousand questions and they answer them all with seemingly good enough answers you think it's going to be fine and it just wasn't and I get into all of the details of all of that in this video but so many people have questions that I wanted to answer that straight away. I didn't want anyone to have to sit through anything they didn't want to and for everyone asking about flights and what I'm doing for all of those kind of people we are working on every possible solution every single day and another reason I've been gone because that is so much more important than making a video. I'm still as we speak figuring out ways to reimburse people who traveled and working on sending free merch to every single person because I want to go out of my way to apologize but like those girls said in chains video there's always going to be people I can't accommodate there's no way to reimburse every flight there's going to be people that are angry for the time they spent and rightfully so and I have to acknowledge all of that and straight up own up to it and apologize for hurting or upsetting anyone and do my best to make it better because that's all I can do and in this video I talk a lot about what was said before tancon to me and how it actually came into play and how things actually happened and the differences between the two and how angry and frustrated I was keep in mind I filmed this monologue like a month ago but at the end of the day I just want to clarify before you even watch this video that I am not placing blame on anyone other than myself I take full blame in this situation as of right now even though people are refunded I am alone wolf and I have to make everything better by myself because when shit goes bad people run even though I'm talking about a lot of other people in ways I was illusioned and horrible people really and the horrible things that they've done and whatever it may be I still take full blame and if you're watching this for one second please don't think that there's any part of me that thinks that I could get away with blaming anyone else because at the end of the day I put my name on the event and I fucked up so I want to tell you if you're watching this if in any way I let you down I'm sorry and I say this at the end of the video and I've said it a lot but just know that I let me down a hundred a thousand times harder even this morning doing the final edits watching the end clips of me and Shane and all this kind of stuff was making me so emotionally and they're editing it and I've come to realize that it's probably something I won't ever be angry about or upset about or have massive regrets but I'm back I'm admitting I've fucked up and I'm ready to continue documenting this journey and I'm grateful for anyone who wants to join me and I'm grateful for Shane because I wouldn't be here and I'm be making this video and I wouldn't have had the balls to ever say anything like I did if it wasn't for him and his abilities who want to uncover the truth and to make art or something that makes people feel out of pain and misfortune is so inspiring to me and it always has been yeah I love you Shane Dawson but yeah I'm gonna shut up now I wanted to give everyone those answers I wanted to tell you how I'm feeling as the morning of this video and I wanted to tell you that I love you and now it's time for past me to walk you through TanaCon in my shoes along with the random video of me and Shane but makes no sense in this but I just wanted you to enjoy it so I'm gonna shut the fuck up now enjoy this or don't I understand either way bye but also high again I've never been so nervous for anything in my darling like for the first time I'm sitting down in front of a camera and I don't know what the fuck to say I've been gone off of social media pretty much for the past two weeks and in the last three and a half years it is the longest break I've taken there's a hundred million thoughts in my brain but at the same time this numb empty loss of words and I think it's time that I stop running from everything and tell you guys my side of the story I guess TanaCon is going to be in favor I want to say something so bad I never thought like a year ago I remember watching KSI talk about having a convention and I was like there's no way I will ever be in a position to have my own convention or in a position where people would want to come to like my convention and to be sitting here a year later and that coming to fruition is so mind blowing to me but yeah I really want to do something free I really want to do something with all of the new fun creators that everyone is super excited to meet and doesn't always get the opportunity to meet and I definitely want to do it around that same time I just yeah I definitely want TanaCon to be a fun free cool experience VidCon's version of fire festival happened it's TanaCon TanaCon was canceled she was gonna create her own called TanaCon TanaCon TanaCon yeah Con's a good word for it quickly descended into chaos he created her own event called TanaCon TanaCon TanaCon TanaCon TanaCon TanaCon TanaCon it's day one of TanaCon TanaCon already waited a little bit TanaCon is over and they sold too many tickets also I want to talk about TanaCon was supposed to be one of the biggest YouTube conventions TanaCon actually ended up being a huge disaster TanaCon is canceled for those TanaCon a thing called TanaCon was supposed to be a giant middle finger to VidCon turned out to be a giant middle finger to her fan base TanaCon was a major bus being wrong or bad or whatever if it's about it's me it's on my fucking face you know your name is the conference literally so I mean I have been putting my heart into making it perfect and no boy it was perfect a few weeks ago TanaCon was something I was excited about it was a dream of mine that was finally coming true or so it felt like it was a dream originated in spite when I saw the paper at good times with sending out that was like fuck VidCon fuck VidCon fuck anyone who created VidCon I literally thought if I make it better but it doesn't stupid and spiteful it was so stupid I think all of the rebellious people and all of the unwanted people should host a little meet and greet in Anaheim California on the same days as VidCon but it was something I was so fucking proud of and I wanted you to be proud of it too for the first time in my entire life career it felt like the whole world was on my side hey I'm gonna back you all as tell everybody that VidCon is the biggest piece of that anybody could go to finally going my way and now fast forward to today I don't even know where to be in honestly I'm sitting at my computer looking at videos with people with some rise crying paramedics I'm reading stories and DMing you guys talking to people who came from Australia and Singapore and China and the UK and New York and travel just to be turned away and settled in the world it's so fucking horrible I'm disgusted I want to walk you through it all good the bad the ugly I want to apologize to everyone I've wronged and so now I want to explain all of my failures to you I could have been so much better how I will be better I want to explain it all so let's do that with as little jump cuts as possible but I can't stop pausing and breathing and I'm fucking terrified it all started with spite so much fun in this fight I was angry I was hurt I was spiteful VidCon I was banned or kicked out or however you want to say and I felt left out I was seeing all my friends featured and I was embarrassed I felt like I should have been a puppet bit I felt like everyone was a part of it I should have been a part of it and I know that sounds ego-tensible to say it was something I looked up to in this industry the biggest convention in this industry for years and I wanted to be a part of it so badly and I pleaded and I pleaded and I waited and I thought I was doing everything right in my power and it still wasn't good enough and I was fucking angry live it to find out for the third year it wasn't gonna happen and so I made a video about it and that's where everything should have stopped after that video it started to snowball and spiral out of control I uploaded that video thinking that that would be it all one hour and 19 minutes of me repeating myself over and fucking over again but then the response was fucking crazy I've never done anything and had a response like that it felt like the whole world was talking about me and I felt that before but not not in a good way like this someone like me that a lot of people don't like doesn't always get to feel like the whole world is on their side after uploading that video to see every single one of my favorite fucking years loved francholy run and so this year she decided to take a huge swing and launched Hannah Kahn and it's not that she just launched her own event that makes the stand out it starts tomorrow at the same time VidCon is happening it is not only in anaheim like VidCon it is it's taking place at the anaheim mariat sweets which is so incredibly close and reportedly there are already 80 confirmed creators to attend and she has a solid range in addition to herself you have Miranda sings rookie Dylan Shane Dawson Casey Neistat Bella Thorne and so I am so fascinated to see how this goes I'm a big fan of alternative events anything that leads to more competition maybe it's a different avenue so whether it's something like a a smaller more niche thing or a direct competitor I mean VidCon this year is expected to have 30,000 people but I think more and more you're gonna see things like a tanacon pop up where people go wouldn't it be more interesting if instead of all of these people it could be one to four thousand of a kind of more central sports rookie Dylan you name them talking about what I'd said it a positive light and all of these creators coming forward telling me they have the same things happen to them or sharing their stories and not only feeling like I I started all of this in this movement but having all these people on my side and having every press talking about you so positively feeling like from once I did something right and that it was a good thing to speak out and tell the truth the response after posting that video was so much better than I anticipated and after releasing the VidCon video I didn't plan on doing anything but everything kept growing and growing and people started tweeting tanacon tanacon tanacon and they'd have every recommence every were whatever and I started to believe that if I had the right person that we that I could actually pull it off which looking back so fun stupid like in two months it's so stupid and as the concept of tanacon became more real and it started picking up steam I decided to release merch to kind of test the waters and see if people really fucked with it I've never seen numbers like that I've never seen that many people wanting to wear a fucking neon orange hoodie that says something dumb and spiteful that I created and this was still all a part of my spiteful joke but I was loving every fucking second of it soon the idea of creating an actual tanacon wasn't a joke anymore I couldn't back down at that point I had to do it every person on the fucking platform was telling me to do it the creators wanted a cool place for their voices to be heard and the fans wanted something cheaper and that's what sucks too is it's just like now because it went so poorly obviously all of that attention is flip-flopped and the negative attention is insane but it's also like with that much attention and people gasping you up and telling you you can do it you start to believe it you really start to believe it but the problem was that it was two months away and that's by far one of the biggest ways I fucked up you don't plan a convention in two months you don't put that many people's lives at risk to do something spiteful you don't do it the same day as VidCon you don't do it down the street I didn't have to be spiteful like that and that's where I fucked up and Jordan knew that he wasn't gonna do it he really really wasn't I should have fucking listened to him I was seeing how much success this was all having and I was on an ego trip and I was so excited to make a change in the fucking industry and I was so excited to finally feel welcome somewhere I needed to find someone else who would help me and then Michael Weiss texted me and suddenly I had a real way to make it happen or so I thought good times I'd been to a previous event with good times and I think that if that had never happened Tannikon would have never happened a few months prior I went to Chicago with good times for a small event that they were doing and they flew me out and Michael was so good to me you know black cars and paparazzi and giant hotel sweets and videographers following me everywhere and anything I wanted the best security everything it was like he put on a show for me he made me feel like royalty he did everything in his power to make me feel like royalty and looking back now it was all lights in a show and none of it was real and I didn't know that yet and when Michael texted me about Tannikon and all I knew of him was this amazing experience in Chicago where I was wind and dined and it was so incredible and whatever of course I was down if you could make a small convention like that go off so seamlessly he obviously knows something about the industry he obviously wouldn't do anything that he couldn't do that he didn't think could be possible this was the guy that was going to make Tannikon a real thing and even though every single person in my life who I introduced him to or who knew him people were coming out of the fucking woodworks to tell me how much they didn't like him and how I shouldn't work with him upon meeting him for the first time I remember Hunter telling me he so stuck up he so he got mystical Bella got the worst vibes and was begging me every day to do Tannikon with her team and god I should have fucking listened I remember months before Tannikon right when everything started happening I went to James Charles's house and had a meeting with him about Tannikon and I remember James sitting there being like do not fucking work with good time standing you're a fucking idiot if you do it and me being like but I believe in him but I believe I believe in him I didn't care I wanted to prove everyone wrong I I want to stray away from emotion in this video and pandering and all that fucking bullshit but I've always been the type of person where I never wanted judge someone based off of everyone else's opinions because I'm always the girl that everyone judges based off of what everyone else has to say and I never want to be that person so if anything everyone fucking telling me not to make me dig my heels in 10 times deeper and the combination of that and the way that Michael is was a cocktail for disaster but I didn't know it there was no backing out now for me Tannikon was a real thing we were a team and we were gonna make it happen and there were so many weird things and so many red flags looking back but I was so blinded by the idea of making my ultimate dream a reality and not even just that but getting back at VidCon showing the industry that there is a repercussions if the big dogs treat the little dogs like shit that eventually one day someone's gonna bite back and wanting to create a place for creators to never be treated the way I was you know and I let all of that cloud the red flags and the weird shit why was he filming himself doing every single thing okay why were people secretly recording me and I was catching them why was all of this for a documentary that I wasn't gonna make and I wasn't gonna ever get any part of or anything like that that I didn't even know about until the first Tannikon meeting he just showed up with cameras and why is he segwaying everywhere why is he dripped in Gucci and Chanel and all that kind of stuff when everyone who knows him says it's his parents money but then he says it's investors but where are the investors and oh wait they're your parents but they're not and I thought you lived in a mansion oh wait you live in your mom's guest house or why are you running around Anaheim after Tannikon was cancelled crying and having someone film you on a segway there's so many why are you going around telling everyone that I fired Jordan and you're my manager now and why are you speaking down to everyone but me why are you telling me that if Tannikon goes well you're gonna buy me a Rolex why are you taking me and all my friends to dinner after dinner at catcha-lay and tell beauty and Essex and no boo and all that bullshit you know why are you bullshitting me so hard and that's what sad is I knew in the back of my mind that something was so fishy but I let my fucking ego and spite drive me to continue to make Tannikon I let the dream of the fantasy of what it could be drive me to continue to do it I let everyone doubting me and telling me not to work with them motivate me 10 times harder to do it because I wanted to prove them wrong I wanted to be the little dog that won Michael made it seem like it be the easiest thing he'd ever done like he could plan Tannikon in two weeks with his eyes closed all I had to do was be the face and the name and maybe invite some creators and he would do everything seamlessly because all he's ever done is plan conventions but I wanted to be hands-on and I wanted to work on it I wanted to do everything to and that's one thing that's infuriating seeing Michael go around and say that Tannikon failed because I could have done more how do we make rooms like this as jope is possible for as cheap as possible we'll have backdrop table chairs um we can put parking up lights to light the walls around it it's a little cool oh man this is also the main stage like this door opens up at two at a certain day um is that other side of this can I see that now if I can get it up to big room and so there's all three and 30 we put the chairs in here we've mapped it out three originally we were going to do 150 I filled it up to 330 last night but everyone of checking here's like a first checkpoint town uh-huh and that's like that's like that's why it's someone's like oh yeah I have to pass on my creator we can check right do you make today actually on the left so we let you can go to registration please never get back saved without a double the problem what was it then it's very big it's supposed to be like the ff lounge whatever they I have nothing to do they want a town longer if they want to be to me we should figure that out yeah I've asked Jen love he's gonna have the audacity to say that it was like that because I could have done more but I told you every item and I told you when I'd reach out to the companies but you told me no that's not my job as the talent that all I have to do is put my face on it and you'll handle it but did you know but it's still all my fault at the end of the day I still attached my face and my name to it and I promoted it and I was down for it and I was ready because I wanted to win and I wanted things to be different as much as I want to paint the picture to you guys that I believed in Michael because I wanted to believe in someone regardless of what everyone said I still believed in someone that gave me bad vibes I wanted to believe the fantasy over the reality I let someone wine and dyeing me and schmooze and lie to me and tell me everything was gonna be fucking flawless and he can do this convention 10 times over with his hands tied behind his back while everyone was fucking telling me that he was the worst and I should have listened and I'm a fucking idiot seeing Michael go around and say oh you were in Hawaii a few weeks before yeah Michael and you were in Nashville so even if I was in LA we still would have met over the phone just like we did every fucking day that I could have done more about the gift bags when I sat in my living room with Hunter Elijah Mario and Mari Ashley Isabella telling you that I wanted merch in the gift bags that I wanted mini clip in hair except in the gift bags that I wanted jewelry and the gift bags and what kind of jewelry that I wanted glitter from lemon head LA or go get glitter and glitter to your packages that I wanted to make up products from color pop and that I wanted to reach out and he told me no he would do it and he'll take care of it and sitting there and ask me him in front of all those people okay so you're gonna have every single one of those items in the gift bag and then getting the tannicon and it being a condom I want to talk about planning planning it all seems ridiculous now with all of this footage but this is something that I worked harder on than I've ever worked on anything in my entire life I became living breathing this is another meetup room and small panels chappin you can put the five drapes right there back drop tables and to the duet color preference of the drapes as well we can put one of those these are like to do an outside pool party and we're can't have a tannicon pool party for the fans will be cool yeah that would be cool we're getting fun boy I think it's bloats you know those expensive that's what bloats they put it like tannicon floats in there or that's really cool but it's like a good place it's fun it's a good place to keep graphic out wow okay in terms you're gonna see who come true kids so Laura is renting out that more stuff well yeah we should do so many photo opportunities things for that there's gonna be like shit just to kind of have fun with and be like there's an open bar there's brunch exactly I really want to endless my mimosas on Saturday morning I can articulate that too big to where it would look like at playlist that stage is never packed wall to wall I know this one's gonna like a show like like a mosh pit but it's a yeah literally I want to almost give off slight warp to her vibes like that which is like oh you got that couple oh yeah like edgy I mean people are gonna go out of round the building there can everywhere like it's gonna be is there gonna be a hurricane at the main stage yeah the reservation some people might not be there yet some people might be flying from really far or whatever I can even think about that so like it's all I'm learning with experience but I like that because that means I'm fucking hands on and I actually care and I'm actually giving you go I don't worry you supposed to reserve me of some person but then you changed it to online right yeah exactly and that's why people like you don't hear us right now I'm like no I'm reading every single thing you're just working and see exactly and proactively going to fix it you know for you for me I'm only human it's tannicon it's not I'm not so I like tannicon robot I sat up every single night going over every goddamn thing with Michael Weist whether it was security whether it was lines outside whether it was merchandise which youtubers merchandise we wanted they're which exclusive merchandise we wanted to make how we were gonna design it every single fucking item that was guaranteed to be in those gift bags the capacities the room the safety the security the 91 security guards that ended up being 25 how many paramedics we wanted which youtubers got which hotel rooms and what I wanted to put it put in them and oh my god and which sponsors I wanted and which companies I wanted there and what I wanted my birthday party to look like I want songs I wanted the fans to hear first and what panels I wanted in every single person on each and every one of those panels and what panel came after which one and what went before the other one and making sure nothing conflicted with anyone's Vidcon experience and asking over and over and over and over and over and over again that the security and the capacity would be fine I asked Michael Weist if the security and the capacity would be fine 500,000 fucking times and every single time I was told yes it will be perfect don't even worry about that don't you're the youtuber you're the talent focus on who you want on what panel are you kidding me of course safety and security isn't it be fine Tana I wouldn't it be but to go even further in what I was responsible for planning it was the concept and foundation of Tana Con but I want to be a little more clear than that the concept and foundation of Tana Con was planned by me and I was going to kick and fucking scream until it got done and I honestly think that this is the most important message I want to convey in this video and the reason why I explained how I was winded and dined and how Michael was and everything that happened is so that I can convey this message I believed that I could place the task of creating a perfect safe happy awesome Tana Con in the hands of Michael Weist and good times did I want to be a pivotal part of creating the event did I want to choose every little thing down to the color of the gift bags and what person was on what panel and every little fucking thing hell yes I did and I did that I was on my phone every second of every day with that man but the responsibility of the logistics and the production and the security and the safety and the lines and the water and the food and the paramedics I placed in the hands of the production company good times because at the end of the day and I'm not falling back on the son of crutch because like I said I'm a fucking idiot forever doing it out of spite and ever doing it in two months and ever doing it on the same day but I still at the time was a 19 year old girl who makes YouTube videos I don't run a convention company and Michael Weist made me believe that he ran the best convention company and he was going to make me the best convention he possibly could he did everything in his power to make me believe that we had plenty of time and the security was going to be fucking on lock and that everyone was going to be inside with plenty of space the gift bags would be full and that all I had to do was tell him what I wanted and he would make it happen and so as the days for Tanikon came up further and further and further I began to realize that Michael was a little dumber than he was a lot dumber than he was putting off to be that the ego was to cover up a lot that there were a lot a lot a lot of lies I think I was beginning to realize that I didn't make the right choice but we're a week away with 4,000 tickets sold I didn't know what to do so I enlist the help of Jordan and we do everything we can to make things as great as possible but again Jordan doesn't run a convention company he's a talent manager so we locked every influencer for every panel and we locked down every sponsor and we locked down everything we could but Michael was allegedly handling all of the things we knew nothing about security venue capacity safety it was scary but I was so excited I went in toward the venue asked about security in other hundred and thousand times asked about capacity another hundred thousand it's a registration we have the whole body we're like yeah to do like we're gonna put the registration booth out there so the key is traffic out because this is frankly 5,000 people a lot of people yeah like you see the space so we've got to make that work we're gonna have a lot of things I'm beginning to realize that every time I spoke to Michael he was telling me something different you know that the capacity is 3,298 oh no wait that's the capacity of the main ballroom oh no wait we now have the lobby so that's another 700 to a thousand people we can hold oh no every hallway holds a hundred people here Tanna come back to Anaheim let's tour all of the offset rooms this room can hold a panel and it can hold 300 people this room can hold this many people outside no one will be in line for that long at all look we set that up meet the security team meet the security guards there's gonna be nine times a completely closed line somebody else we have to do no body really probably slam your head maybe like this I don't know who she said maybe I don't know maybe somebody that gets on my nerves see how the face piercing well it's gonna be how annoyed you're gonna get me okay so there's an off team meet the security guards there's gonna be 91 that's double more than we need everyone's gonna be so safe Tanna con I remember laying in bed the night before with Hunter watching Philip DeFranco's first video on it but we'll see personally I hope it does well because the success of others and people being more independent in this community leads to more success for others being independent in this community just falling my eyes out happy tears because I felt like I'd finally made a positive footprint in the community I remember walking into Tanna con off of a party bus with all my friends running into the arms of the fans outside bawling and then right after that Michael and his videographer Phil told me and Hunter that we could never fucking have that footage because it was for a documentary that they were filming but that's beside the point but even that was weird you know why was Michael's entire video team threatening me and my videographer because they all in the right stall the footage why was Michael calling himself the CEO of Tanna con in my manager that night when he wasn't and now Tanna con and started it was the morning of and where was Michael he was cheering champagne on a segue running around while Jordan and I were actually planning everything he was making sure the good times posters were hung up while not giving a fuck about the thousand fans that were already lined up outside and what's crazy is even the first three or four hours of Tanna con there was already so many horrible things happening so many people were stuck outside and the kids' parents were atrocious good to meet us but I can't wait that because I would find my mom yeah my mom was having his team shed wool over my eyes and told me that everything was fine walking beside Michael on a segue he goes I'm gonna walk you over hop on the segue yeah we're going to the filthy bang room which Bella was up until like six in the morning last night building out I'm making crazy it's a party in there okay I'm excited to see what you know but for both of you actually for all three right after this panel is the wedding so we all still okay but I'm sure I have to train my my my my I also have an uncut so so easy right so easy right a little outfit change I'm about to marry two people I got ordained I'm actually a minister actually very excited for Jordan to see how I look they know I think this is the most close people that we're seeing you are so I'm gonna try one of the ones for my pride and you're all everybody and I'm so excited yeah I mean I thought so so I was doing panels and and hosting a Q&A with Lena and Adam and hosting a Q&A with Emma and hosting the wedding and I was crying every 20 minutes because I thought everything was fucking perfect I thought my dreams had finally come true I thought I was in my literal heaven I haven't even started my Tana Con vlog yet but Kira's here and she has something for you to open so you have to sit it's my game I keep forgetting it's my birthday and people keep talking about birthday presents and I get it's so out of the hall what's up Tana Con vlog I just hopped up in the rain Tana concerted I have a convention this isn't feel real I'm dying what hello we didn't have a speaker so we were all playing the same songs out of our phone out once to try to amplify the music it's been an interesting ride I'm about to get out and see the first Tana conference thus far I'm excited okay so this is Tana's vlog yeah I just like to say this is the job of shit I've ever experienced but I have I have all this stuff I have to do tomorrow and guess what I'm pumped for it because it's for Tana Con it's not for some stupid ass money sucking ass shit it's for fun and it's for Tana and it's for you and we just love it see it tomorrow wow I'm so emotional it's gross like that made my left side I don't know why the right I didn't but the left side teared up like hardcore hey guys we're at i-hob oh my god who is this because if it's no way I will there's segway charging outside my room which is open maybe I'm gonna get murdered yes yeah yeah yeah I'm trying to live good morning Tana Con vlog make up I say I came all the way here to make me less ugly yeah that's cool I literally was like fuck these bitches everyone asked me to never come and I was like no uh Tana con day one today's my last day being a teenager uh sorry I was like you're about to die with something Philip D'Refranco did a video on me last night and I was up till 6am because I was so happy I couldn't sleep good morning Tana con day one vlog we're headed to the opening of Tana con I don't know what the fuck to say I'm so emotional do you want to just lie down for a minute? 11 minutes? 11 minutes I think I can't hold the clothes make sure good morning how are you guys? I actually feel welcome dude you all guys I love you that's cool but one kicked us out but little did I know every time I walked out of a room everyone is freaking the fuck out because everything was going wrong because Michael didn't do shit and Michael didn't know shit and after a few hours I'm about to do a Q&A on stage with Gabby I find out it's doomsday we are in absolute doomsday snow I'm gonna do it again Tana con is canceled and there are thousands of people outside and that everything is going horribly and of course I'm a selfish asshole and I go upstairs to change my clothes and make Gabby wait and just suck and while I'm up there I'm getting text from it and I'm being told that there are 20,000 people outside Michael is going around to everyone bragging telling everyone there's 20,000 people outside Tana congratulations he's making it seem like the best thing ever look out the window everything's fine no one's even mad at you it's 20,000 people outside they love you so much everything's gonna be fine it's 20,000 20,000 when we count I can't even tell you how many times Michael came to tell me that it was 20,000 people and he was so excited and that's what's the most fucked up to me 15,000 people an honest decent person in that moment would have said I fucked up and there's 5,000 people outside maybe and they all have sunburns and they're all sobbing and bawling their eyes out and Tana con win horribly and I fucked you over and I'm sorry but no he's riding around on a segway telling me to go on Instagram live and thank everyone for the 20,000 people and go outside with Bella and hand out some waters and everything's gonna be fine and we'll do Tana con day two and that was pretty much the last I saw of Michael liberally he segwayed away had his camera guy fill film him crying running around anaheim while Jordan and I sat in a boardroom trying to figure out what the fuck to count stairs so I'm gonna have a meeting with them and then we're gonna come back up here and discuss what we do that's what's crazy to me too is that after all of this Michael had the audacity to say that I I just went out and partied that night will know I sat in a boardroom for five hours and your entire team who's terrified of you and I still don't know why you an entire team of good time staff was terrified of you finally spoke up to me and told me all of the lies you told me and now there's no way we can actually do a day two and even though Michael's saying that and that we can fix everything that he didn't do anything right I found out in that boardroom that the morning of he cancelled the paramedics because he didn't want to spend the money on it that he cut the security guards in half that he was on Instagram DMing always again USA asking them to print him black shirts that said security hey man T-Brush they remember me now maybe I have to talk with Adam remember me I don't have to talk the way I'm your name's Clinton and I work security for Terican it's crazy as you guys can see it's about 20 to 30 thousand kids up there and they got little with me and my team out here trying to keep keep these guys in line shit is no joke it is no joke I thought there were more security guards that if I were to do a day two that someone would probably die and that I was lucky that no one died today that was the first time in that boardroom that I got to hear the truth about Tannicon that his team finally broke down and stopped lying to me stop being afraid of him it was all a facade and that the smartest thing to do would be to cancel it for the safety and happiness of my fans that was one of the most devastating moments of my life everything was like this you know everyone was talking about it it was going to be so amazing it was going to be so perfect the security's fine everything's going to be great though hotel capacities fine while you finally made a change whatever just kidding it's all alive you're lucky your fans didn't die today the security isn't real security and the paramedics were canceled Michael Weiss would rather spend that money on Chanel earrings your gift bags were a condom I didn't know what to do I was in shock mode I thought it would be the best thing to do to leave the Marriott and to go to my networks party and to talk to you guys outside there were like a hundred fans outside so I went and talked to them to talk to all the people in the industry inside of the party and I started vice to apologize to creators to try to start mopping up the mess and for him to go in an interview and say that I was just out partying while all I was trying to do was damage control the thousands of fucking lies he told to me and figure something out and he truth is the most angering thing and to be so goddamn angry I bid con for three years and now to sit back and be 10,000 times more angry at the one person I thought I could trust to help me pull this off is devastating to want nothing more than for TanaCon to go well and to see videos of third fucking degree sunburns and people on stretchers hear the stories of the fans who were still there that traveled all the way from Australia and London and wherever else is soul shattering and so infuriating because I would have never done TanaCon if I knew it was gonna happen like that but now that left Jordan and I to mop up the mess and then we come to find out all of the numbers there weren't 20,000 people outside and now I look like a fucking idiot the venue could never have held 5,000 people and it was oversold the security was a fucking joke but at the end of the day I put my name on it my idea originated in spite and I made a huge fucking mess and I have to clean it up past two weeks I've been radio silent everyone wanted to know immediately why I wasn't making a video and why I wasn't addressing it and all of that kind of stuff this is why I didn't know what the fuck to say I didn't know what the fuck was the truth I didn't know what the fuck was a lie I didn't know what the fuck was going on and I didn't want to sit down and talk about it until I knew every damn thing and what's crazy is everyone thinks that after Shane's video came out that I knew everything and I'm still being silent for no reason or whatever I'm still finding out so much stuff to this day refunds like I told you earlier Michael hid showed up to my birthday party to tell me that he loved me and wished me a happy birthday I said I don't know what to say because even I almost understood by everyone was so afraid of him and then he left Anna I'm back to Nashville on a plane stranded all of the creators that were still in Anna I'm and started hitting him up about refunds and I heard no response I started calling him and calling him and then I see that he went outside and told people that Jordan wasn't responding during all of Tannicon when in reality Jordan was the only person trying to hold anything together so that was what he did before he left and I became very aware that the only people who actually cared about the fans and their refunds were Shane James the other creators I start hearing rumors from everyone that Michael knows that he's telling everyone he's just fine and he made 450 grand from Tannicon and then Bryce start showing me all the fake bake statements that Michael used to make to show him how much money he had before he stole his and then Michael sees that Shane is gonna make a Tannicon video and then starts becoming so responsive and he's upset and he's gonna lose his house and he's going bankrupt but the bank statements he sent me were fake and I don't believe any of that for a damn second and now suddenly he's so upset and he cares so much and so we all start discussing refunds and it's very prevalent that Michael doesn't know what the fuck to do I might have to write a check in issue refunds myself and then after I think Shane realized all of this he was nice enough to help the situation and I appreciate Shane so much more than you'll ever know I know that that's not what this is about but no one knew all of this for the last two weeks and Shane was the only person to listen and understand that I'm a fucking idiot and call me out on all my bullshit but still give me a platform to transparent they tell this story on and care about the refunds and care about the fans and talk to Michael and I don't think Michael would have ever talked to me if it wasn't for Shane so I'm so grateful for his position in that sense and Shane's my fucking dad we all know I would be dead if it wasn't him so not I'm gonna get into that but I don't even know what I would do in this situation if it wasn't for Shane fucking Dawson he could have walked away so easily all he was was a creator that reluctantly agreed to show up in my event and to take on this responsibility is the greatest thing someone could ever do for me and I will never be able to repay him but you all know that and for him to forgive me and still talk to me every day and listen to me means the world now here we are present day in my house coming back to the world facing this head-on sitting in the same spot that I was so spikedfully screamed at VidCon and so now I've been spending every single day trying to work on a perfect solution but the truth is nothing will ever make this fully right and it will be one of the biggest regrets of my life for the rest of my life I'm gonna do everything I can to make it right and as much as I want to be radio silent and continue to hide the good parts of my intentions the parts of me that wanted to be the voice for the creators and make it change in this industry and make it change in the way that creators are treated and be the voice of people who are treated like shit and give the fans what they deserve that voice in me doesn't want to back down because if I were to back down and give up on the right things that I believed in that would be losing in my eyes put to everyone that's out here calling me a con artist Tanna conned Tanna you're an evil mastermind you're a piece of shit whatever I didn't make a fucking dime on Tanna con and now I will be losing my money if anyone thinks that I went into Tanna con for anything other than a wild fucking dream fueled by a fuck ton of spite you were wrong I take it for 65 dollars and Michael spent every dime that was earned but I didn't do it for the money I did it because I wanted to create a better different event was it fueled by spite was it fueled by ego what I've been so persistent if I wasn't getting the attention and the press and all of the crazy shit that was happening probably not but I knew from day one that I wasn't making a dime that it was for the greater good of the industry that it was for making a footprint in this world that it was for doing something dope and cheap for once for the fans I wanted something free I wanted free tickets that's another fucking conversation I remember texting Michael every four or five days all the way up until Tanna con being like okay drop 200 free tickets and he'd be like okay 200 tickets are live on the site right now I did this probably like 10 times but then coming to see that every single person outside waiting in line and paid for a ticket so you were lying to me about how many free tickets were given away so that you could profit more I wanted all free tickets such a fucking mess now I'm spending my time working on free meetups and as many of the most popular cities no matter where they are of people who bought tickets and stuff for charity with Shane starting from the ground up again with the same morals of what I believed in when I made those videos but with a whole hell of a lot less spite and a giant slap in the face from reality and a whole fuck ton of trust issues a long time ago someone said to me you want something done right do it yourself and that's where I am with all of this I will never blindly trust anyone again I will never let ego and spite fuel the decisions I make with someone if everyone tells me not to fuck with a person in the business industry I'm not gonna do it as much as that sucks it's the truth I'm not gonna do things without months of planning I'm not gonna do things like Tanna con a lot of change has to be made I'm gonna stick to what I know I'm gonna research everything I can I'm gonna look at everything that went wrong so I know how things can go right I'm gonna work with Jordan David Marona and that's about it because he's the only fucking person in this industry who isn't a snake I'm gonna be more guarded people are secretly filming me and telling me if I sell this many tickets they're gonna buy me a Rolex I'm gonna tell him to get the fuck out of my house if James Charles the smartest sister in this fucking industry tells me not to trust I'm gonna listen I'm working on everything I can to figure out how to accommodate all of the travel funds of people who traveled but in the meantime I am so sorry I'm sorry if you came to Tanna con I'm sorry if you were to sunburn I'm sorry if you waited in line I'm sorry you didn't get to meet your favorite creators I'm sorry that you ever even had to look at that sorry excuse for it gift bag I'm sorry if you believed in me if I let you down and I'm sorry for fucking this up sorry for being ego-tistical spiteful selfish stupid irresponsible I'm gonna do everything in my power to make it right and I'm not gonna give up for the voice of the fucking creators and the voice of the fucking fans I'm not gonna stop trying because I would be a sorry excuse of I don't want to say a role model but you know what I mean if I came on here weeks ago preaching never to give up on your dreams and then because one thing went wrong I'm gonna give up forever that's not who I am and that's not who I want you guys to be and that's not a god damn message I'm gonna spread on this channel but thank you for listening thank you for watching this thank you for being on this journey with me thank you for letting me tell you what happened I was lied to so much if never been and I probably never will be more lied to in my entire life by anyone I trusted a horrible person and a horrible company Michael Weist and his entire staff of people who terrified of him fucked me over brutally but I'm still a fucking idiot for attaching myself to it and letting it happen I knew better and I'm fucking stupid and I'm sorry if you think I let you down just know I let me down so much harder I just want to say thank you to Shane and thank you to you guys it's time to pick up the pieces figure the shit out but I just mean like my videos like coming back like everything I'm just I'm just afraid of them to scare as well this is crazy I do think everything happens for reason I think that this happened to show people just because you have a bunch of followers and just because people like you you don't you shouldn't throw a convention in them up straight up okay so sure yeah I think the whole tone of the convention was negative started out kind of like oh you know this is for whatever and oh this is gonna be for the creators this is gonna be this is that but like the closer it got to it the more just became fuck VidCon I agree which I didn't even know really because I wasn't really looking into it I wasn't ever like down for that but I didn't do anything to stop it you know like I'm on their message to creators when they wrote fuck VidCon I didn't do that I didn't prove that I didn't see that that was a surprise to me but I also didn't stop it so I take the blame for that and I made the video you know saying VidCon did me dirty I want to do something the same day and that was petty I should have never done it the same day were my mantras and shit of you know the creators having a better time true of course they were at a horrible time with VidCon I was treated horribly so many creators were two and I wanted to do something better but 10 on new slash you can't do that in a month with a 20 year old yeah like it's just not possible and I should have thought about it one big question that a lot of people are still gonna have is why did it take you so long to respond and to tweet and why was I the one that was telling everybody was canceled you didn't ask me to do that but I did it because I was like somebody else like oh this shit this is canceled this shit's bad this is not safe I mean first of all like I have told you from the beginning I didn't know things were going bad at tanagon until an hour after like everything like I was doing stuff on stage they were telling me everything was absolutely fine it wasn't told me and bellow went up to my hotel I'm and actually saw the people outside and we're like let's go down with water that I knew of shit was actually horrible and by that time people are already ready for a response ever since any scandal I've had everything bad in the past the one thing I've learned is you don't want to be impulsive you don't want to go live and say bullshit that doesn't you know account for things and I've done that so much in the past like impulsive tweeting impulsive bullshit I felt like it was better for me to sit back reflect and when I went to talk about it make sure that everything I was saying was factual make sure that everything I was saying with apologetic and be taking the blame whatever and I wanted to think about it but still I waited too long it probably would have been a better time to be impulsive and say everything on my mind and like you were saying earlier to me on the phone if I went there and I had that experience and it was that bad I would have been straight to Twitter if I have a bad experience on a fucking airline I'm on Twitter talking about it so for me to go silent in that moment was dumb but I was just fucking scared and I wanted to make sure that what I said was true were you afraid of dragging good times I still am even just after everything that we filmed I hate to place the blame on anyone but myself because of the end of the day like in my head like I'm angry on myself for this this is my fault it's tannin on you fucked up being able to talk to you and shine a light on the fact that I was being told that everything was fucking perfect and I was researching and trying to do everything I could and being told it was all perfect and then it didn't end up being and that maybe you know other people did have a lot to contribute in this getting fucked up just feel good and knowing that you're a credible source and you wouldn't put anything out there unless it was fucking true as fuck feels good because I feel like if I went on my channel and was like you know fuck good times with my go this sucks whatever it wouldn't be as credible it would just be whining about shit you know and I think it was very like the wrong message for your audience and for people in general which is I know you have this whole thing of like oh I'm gonna fight for the little guy and whatever and I stand by that it looks like it was more of an ego trip because you called it tannin con you know what I mean you call it 10 on the roster is me yeah who doesn't go to conscience you have it's literally Shane con casey yeah like straight up Casey nice that who like yeah is you know I was with James Charles who I I don't know that well yet I met I don't count them a few times I'm sitting there with Ryle and I'm sitting there with his sister and Andrew we're all freaking out panicking and I'm seeing this Instagram live where you're just like talking about how like you can't believe there's so many people not to they're out there burning and stuff yeah exactly and it's like in the moment you know yeah it was James typing something caddy in the chat no it was me behind the phone being like what the fuck is she doing yeah trying to call you text you gonna what the fuck are you doing I think I called you right after that 100 because it's just like that looks so bad that is literally why as soon as I saw everything I often said I know everyone's angry and whatever but I want to thank Shane and James because everyone is sitting you're telling me congratulations like you got 20,000 people here it's Michael trying to fix things and whatever being like 10 of no you did a great job whatever until I'm seeing all these people fucking sunburns and like of course you guys are standing up for what's right especially you're on this line of your names attached to what all these things are happening like like I I wish I would have known sooner that that shit was happening so that I never did tweet or live stream like that because that's not that what you say when that's happened and now she's not here to defend herself but Bella who is on the roster too who's like with you the whole time tweeting like oh security's being an asshole yeah I'm in that moment we're upstairs in our room being told you know security's just being jerk people had to wait a little too long a bunch of people just showed up it's 20,000 congratulations it's fine the party lots big whatever and it wasn't until hours and hours later when I'm actually seeing videos of what and tweets of what was happening the second we realized all this people outside yeah we ran down to give them water and shit like that but we're still being told like it's fine though they're leaving you're gonna be on for tomorrow like it's you know just security or church and obviously Bella too like she's invested in this but not as much as me you know she's selling her merch and she's there and she's supporting me it's not her job to know all the security stuff like I thought I knew all of that you know I thought security was gonna be great and whatever and there were told all their jerks I'm gonna not jerk to you how you're a horrible fucking company of half the people that you said was gonna be there and they didn't know what they were doing you know yeah sure you're not being fed a lot of bullshit I don't know if you want that what do you think about and I don't know if you know this but VidCon was like helping and was trying to help and like called me and called people and like came to the parking lot and helped kids with their sunburns and helped kids get to be honest with you knowing that they in those moments were caring about the fans and the creators and all that kind of stuff just in general then make this industry possible makes me really see them in a different light and I didn't know that and I think it's really fucking cool yeah and I don't even know if I'm allowed to say that but like fuck it I'll just say what are they going to do to me like honestly they they were so like we want to help we know we know fuck VidCon we know all that stuff but like this is more important to like make sure everybody's okay and Tan is okay and everybody involved is okay because this is like some crazy the girls we interviewed earlier they said that people from VidCon were helping them like finding places to go and stuff yeah so that's crazy and the reason I bring that up is just to put things in perspective because I know what it's like trust me I have had so many companies constantly even now fuck me over in so many ways I have had brand deals fault there I have had companies steal my ideas I have a TV never steal my ideas I have had YouTube itself fuck me over constantly yeah and yes would I love to start my own YouTube yeah fuck yeah if that ever happens I know it's gonna take a long time to do something you did I took from this you know how much time it actually takes to do things hard work yeah exactly you can't prepare things overnight like that yeah and expect them to be perfect you're right I feel I trust you as not just an audience member but somebody who was very very mad at you earlier today like I was pissed for every right reason you're not even mad now or less matter whatever like you're not live it you're not screaming you're not hitting me in the face right now is beyond me I deserve it you can hit me in the face I mean fine it's gonna be fine thank you for doing this this has been the craziest experience I've ever seen but more importantly we're gonna figure out how to fix this and we're gonna exactly that's all that it'll work get the refunds do the fact that we can even say we that you care about me mean so much more our journey hey thank you thank you Ricky thank you Ricky thank you productivity"
026_Olivia," Hi everyone, it's Olivia Jade. Welcome back to my channel. This video obviously looks really different and it's just gonna be really quick. I just woke up. But yeah, I just want to say something that's been on my mind a little bit since I posted my last video because even when I posted it, I felt like a little weird. But then like seeing all the comments, it confirmed that I should have felt a little weird posting it and basically I sat in that video like there was a question about college and I said like, oh, I'm not excited to do the schoolwork. I just want to like party. I said something super ignorant and stupid basically and it totally came across that I'm not grateful for college. I'm going to a really nice school and it just kind of made it seem like I don't care. I just want to brush it off. I'm just going to be successful on YouTube and not have to worry about school and I watch it back and I read the comments and I'm just really disappointed in myself. I'm not here to make excuses or whatever and obviously I could have done worse. But it's just annoying and frustrating to look on, I guess, because I'm not like that and I just, I didn't mean it that way. So I'm not trying to like come out here and defend myself for anything. But I just genuinely want to say I'm sorry for anyone I've offended by saying that I know that it's a privilege and it's a blessing and I'm really grateful. I think a lot of people obviously like to attack me because I've grown up a different life and again, that's not me. I see everything I say I'm like walking on eggshells because I'm freaking out about saying something wrong. But I just want to be real with you guys. I guess a lot of people like to attack me for the way I've grown up because it's really different from a lot of people. And so anything I say that's even remotely just ignorant or bratty or something that I genuinely don't mean it gets so much backlash and that I feel really, really bad that even say stuff like that because I just don't mean to sound that way. And again, I just wanted to come on here and say I'm really sorry to anyone I offended by saying I wasn't excited to do like school work and for anything else I said that just made me sound kind of like an idiot. I hope that you guys accept my apology if I for like offended you. And yeah, I love you guys. I'll be back tomorrow with just like a clothing haul. Something a little bit more lighthearted, but I hope that besides that question the rest of the Q&A was semi enjoyable because it was personal I guess. I don't know. Again, I'm just sorry for being a freaking idiot and thanks to the stuff that I don't mean. I this video is already three minutes and it's probably just so boring, but yeah, I love you guys and I'm I'm going to be better and I'm not going to say stuff like that without thinking twice about everything about who that could hurt because that's never my goal. I would never ever ever want to offend or hurt my subscribers. Okay, the gate's ringing. I'm going to go. I love you guys and I'll see you tomorrow. Bye."
027_Grave,"Hey everybody, let's see if we can have a quick conversation. If I can clarify some things, answer some questions, clear the air. I'm gonna try and make this brief. I know a lot of people have been wondering where I'm at and what's going on. Basically, I wanted to wait to make this video to determine if I can make this video or if I should make this video and to ensure that my video and my actions resulted in no consequences. Or people being fired or people getting in trouble or the manager or anything with my Starbucks store. And I put up a video, you know, a Starbucks rant which was stupid and short-sighted and I realized that it did. You know, make me seem like an asshole and entitled in whatever words we would like to use to describe me or the situation or my mood in that video. I mean, I don't really have an excuse for uploading that video. I literally was just coming here on my second channel to Vens and complain or whine about something that I completely perceived as a policy change. And maybe I can talk about that just a little bit. But if I knew then what I know now, I would have never made that video. All I can do is say, of course, I regret posting the video and I apologize for posting the video. I feel like anybody who does like know me, who is familiar, you know, know me as much as you can know any YouTuber. But people who are familiar with me, I think you can tell in all honesty that I would never genuinely, knowingly, do something harmful to other people. That's just literally not the type of individual that I am and it's utterly up to you. It's your choice to believe whatever you want to believe about me. But in complete and total honesty, it is not my intention to ever do anything harmful. Most videos here are longer format. So a 30-minute long video is not out of the norm on this channel and most videos on this channel do not hit 100,000 views and my video, my original rant was up. I don't know if it was like two and a half or three full days, but in that time, it performed like a normal banana peppers video should. It got around, you know, 70-something thousand views, 6,000 likes and about 600 dislikes. So it was really not out of the norm of any other video on this channel. I would like to try and like clarify some things that I said in the video and anything that I didn't make clear is obviously my fault. I definitely did not speak eloquently in that video. I tried to voice that I was very irritated that day, very irate. I tried to recognize I sound brady that it sounds bitchy. You know, I just I knew that that wasn't like obviously the greatest, you know, side of myself, but we all do and say things that we regret that we wish we hadn't done or said. You know, that we wish we could take back. I do feel like even though you maybe wouldn't do or say exactly what I said or did, you might do something that's roughly the same. Do you know what I'm saying? This is my norm is to just come to YouTube and kind of like especially on banana peppers, just sort of like plop down and just kind of say whatever I'm thinking, whatever I'm feeling, just sort of like in a stream of consciousness style. I'm not ever really you know, sketching out or thinking what the videos on this channel are going to be. It's just sort of like, oh, something happens and I end up talking about it, you know. This was certainly never a situation that I was trying to garner a lot of support for that I thought I was in the right or I wanted a bunch of people to rally for me. You know, this is not where my core audience is. This was never a graveyard girl situation. This was just me as a person feeling irritated and feeling like kind of weird. It's just something that just made me feel bad and I was just kind of like lashing out and just sort of like regurgitating these things that I was feeling. It doesn't make it right and it doesn't make it acceptable and it doesn't condone the behavior. I'm just describing sort of what my thought process was and where I was coming from. So I think two of the biggest things that people found the most angering was that I said, I'm looking for new breezes to come in or I'm ready to see fresh faces and that literally did not mean that I wanted or hoped that a bunch of people would get fired and it would be a whole new crew that would hopefully cater to my every whim. I was, you know, there's certain crews that work at certain times that work on certain days and different crews work on certain days and I was just having like weird. Once again, I can't get into details and specifics but it's just like, if I knew then what I knew now, it's like I would not have taken it that way and I would not have interpreted it that way but I was literally just looking for a new crew of people. Like I literally know probably nine tens of the entire group of breezes that work at this location and so I literally did not mean anything like that about that statement. Once again, it's my fault completely for not expressing myself in a better way or just not talking about it at all and then the other thing that I did say in the video was, oh, I was thinking about calling the district manager or I was going to call the district manager. Once again, I totally realized how that comes off without extra context which is, you know, I've had many conversations with the district manager before. She's a very nice person and literally I thought it sort of is, it sort of isn't, this is definitely a very gray area issue but I literally thought that this was an absolute policy that for whatever reason this particular store might have ended or changed or whatever and so I literally was going to call and say, hey, you know, is this going to be something, is this going to be a change that's going to last forever? Is there maybe another store, you know, that's kind of like around driving distance from me that might be following the same policies still? It was not, oh, I want to call the district manager and report this situation or get anyone fired. That's just not how I think about things. I did not put this video up with any ill intent. I just literally wanted to riff and get stuff off my mind. I've come to find out that once again, this is sort of like a gray area policy. I don't really want to get into the terminology of the policy or what I thought was in place or what I thought was going on. I do know that I absolutely was not receiving special preferential treatment at this store. This is just the way the store was being operated. There were many, many, many regular customers that were receiving refills. It was not just me. I don't want to get into specifics of like how many people and who and what and why I was absolutely so convinced that this was a policy. I mean, despite the fact that obviously the Starbucks website like states what the policy is, I've even had many conversations with baristas from other stores and whatever. Different policies seem to be enacted differently in different stores that are run by different people that are in different portions of the country that are in target versus a free scanning store that's maybe like a franchise versus something else. I mean, yes, I do understand that they have an overall policy, but it's just literally like when something is part of your norm and then it just, like at the time, it's just like I didn't have all this additional information from the various people that are directly in my life. I thought it was the norm and I thought that overall for whatever reason the norm was no longer the norm and I was frustrated by it. It doesn't mean that I ever would want anything to happen to this store or any of the baristas that work there, et cetera, et cetera. It just means that I was I rate about a company changing its policy. I didn't call attention to this situation. It was quite apparently like something that was already, like it's something that Starbucks is as a corporation attempting to crack down on. There are quite apparently many people that do do what I was doing, which is, you know, going throughout the day, purchasing various drinks and getting a refill, you know, along with making other purchases. And there were quite apparently people that were just getting, you know, ton, just not being honest about it and truly abusing the system, which that does suck that, you know, there are people that do take advantage of things like that and then that's why nobody can get it. But as I thought and as I suspected, this was not some special preferential treatment that I was being given because, you know, I'm graveyard girl. Like as if that really means anything in the scope of the entire world. It doesn't. I know a lot of people want to know why I privatized the video. And, you know, it's just like literally, I'm a human being and I said something stupid and I did something stupid and, you know, I logged back in to upload like the last video on this channel, which was like that squishy video, whatever, logged back in. It's not like I had forgotten I had done the rant. It just wasn't on the forefront of my mind like nobody was really talking about it. It wasn't really a big deal. It was just a banana peppers rant video. It wasn't a great video. And I agree it was bitchy. It was crappy and it was stupid and it was cringe worthy. But at least now I have the answers and I know that anything that I said or that I did, you know, in this little and inconsequential channel that I have did not harm or hurt or affect anyone, which made me feel better because, you know, basically what happened is I just literally thought, oh, this is not, you know, this is not going to be a big deal. It's not buzzworthy. It's just me being an idiot and ranting about something that literally I knew I was being a brat and I really did try to express that it wasn't even really a problem. But if you wanted to call it a problem, it was definitely a first world problem. I was never trying to compare it to any real issues or real problems. I was just literally trying to get, you know, blow off steam, I guess you could say. But, you know, I had logged back into upload the latest video on this channel and, you know, I saw that Starbucks rant and I was like, oh my god, this is just so stupid. Like it's just kind of like one of those moments where you just like put your foot in your mouth, you know? So I had already had it in my mind that I wanted to privatize the video or delete it whatever language we want to use. But I decided before I did, let's just open it up and see what people are saying, right? Can't hurt. Clicked on the comments and the very first comment that I just so happened to read, I don't know if it was like the top comment or whatever, but it was like, oh my god, she's going to get so many people fired. And that comment literally filled me with such complete and total panic over the situation that I absolutely, you know, if I didn't already intend to privatize the video at that point, I definitely would have privatized it. And, you know, then that sort of started the thing of like, well, I want to go talk to people. I want to make sure that I haven't done any harm that I couldn't possibly get anybody in trouble. And I just basically wanted to talk to the people that I talk to every day. I still talked to them every single day and just, you know, say, hey, this is what I said. I was mad. I acted like an asshole. I said things that I wouldn't say again. I said things that I regret. And, you know, literally only one person there, like new that I had made the video. And I mean, who knows? Like people might be saying they didn't see it. Maybe they did. I'm just saying, I explained myself. I apologized. Nobody is treating me any differently. Nobody is, you know, making a big deal out of it. I've talked to, you know, some higher up people and, you know, it's just not on the radar, you know, what I mean. I haven't really been addressing it or talking about it or wanting a lot of people to like tag starbucks or anything else until I got all the answers, you know, that it was embarrassing on my part. But not harmful. The only thing that I do find upsetting is that this has sort of like morphed into some narrative that I am rude to baristas or I'm rude to, you know, people that work anywhere. And once again, I can't convince you of that. I do say that I make an honest, honest effort like every human being I think should, to say, please, and thank you. Can I have this? Could I get that? Am I willing to commit and say that every experience with me is a bag of rainbows? Definitely not. I feel like I'm a person just like anybody else. I've got good days. I've got bad days. I'm sure sometimes I'm pleasant to be around and I'm pleasant to deal with and I'm sure some days I'm unpleasant to be around and unpleasant to deal with. And I do attempt to be kind and courteous to everyone. Do I always remember to say please and thank you, etc, etc. every single time? No, I don't. I feel like anything that I was doing and anything that I still do is strictly out of familiarity with people normalcy of the situation. It's not because I feel like I'm special or entitled. I still just roll up to this day and say, hey, it's bunny. Can I get my blank? A lot of times they will greet me before and they'll just say, hey, what do you want? What are you here for? I mean, once again, like I don't, I don't think that that's rude when people don't greet me with the official like, hi, it's a welcome to Starbucks or whatever they say. I have no idea. I haven't heard that greeting in forever. Like because we just like, I just don't have that conversation with people. There are certain baristas that I do prefer over others. Once again, just out of like familiarity or they make the drinks a little bit different. And I feel like any barista I've ever known, like some people will say, hey, I'm really good at making frappuccinos over this. So, you know, once again, was I driving through and requesting certain people sometimes to make my drinks? Sure. Did I think that that was bad or rude or an inconvenience? No. It's just out of familiarity with a group of people and, you know, just the mo of how things have always been. I've got lots of baristas, you know, that are extremely kind to me and they still ask me this. Like, they know like, oh, sometimes the coffee gets brewed a little strong or the tea gets brewed a little strong. So they'll ask, hey, would you like a little extra milk or could you take actually, usually they're like, oh, would you take a sip of that before you leave and just, you know, tell us what you think? Do you need a little extra classic? Do you need a little extra milk? Whatever, sometimes they'd pass me through, you know, a little like a travel cup with sweetener and I would just dump it in and start up shake it up myself, whatever. Sometimes they would just say, hey, it's easier if we just remake it and give you a whole new one. I mean, that was just something that was offered to me and sometimes I took them up on that offer and sometimes I did all the things that I was trying to say in the video. I didn't get out, right? Obviously, you know, my big thing was is I perceived it as a policy change. It is somewhat of a policy change. But my thing was I was trying to compare it to like a Sephora of the IB Rouge situation where Starbucks is obviously not like shopping in a grocery store or getting gas. It's a luxury. It's something, you know, it's like a treat and so is shopping for makeup at Sephora. It's a luxury. It's a treat. It's not a necessity. And, you know, people have been saying for years myself included that the VIB Rouge program or VIB kind of sucks. They don't really seem to give you many rewards for being such a loyal customer. And so that's sort of what I was trying to equate it to. I think in the original video, I said coupons or something stupid like that. Literally what I was thinking in my mind is, you know, I feel like and maybe I'm ignorant in this. You might agree with me. You might not agree with me. Ultimately, I don't believe this view is harmful in any way. But I don't see a problem with, you know, these larger corporations giving more perks to their most loyal customers, which yes, I have a gold card. You do rack up stars or whatever like that with purchases. And I think it's like every 125 stars or something gives you a free item of your choice. You know, it can be like food or drink or whatever. So yes, they do have some things like that. But I overall do wish that they would give more jurisdiction to individual stores and, you know, relying on the intelligence of the baristas. They know, you know, which customers have been in, which customers frequent, which customers are regular, which customers aren't. But I also do see the fallacy of that logic that obviously, you know, if you have things in place for regulars, you know, I do understand the fallacy of that logic. I'm just saying it would be nice if Starbucks, you know, maybe did have some sort of like regulars program or something like that. I mean, it might not be realistic, but a girl can dream, right? That was sort of like the meatiness of the argument. I did say that, oh, you know, I feel like maybe not getting the refills would promulgate me to go less, but I feel like I've sort of been explaining and snippets that I'm trying to make healthier choices. One being I think that I should frequent Starbucks less. I think I should consume less caffeine, less sugar, etc, etc. And so I was just thinking, you know, maybe if I wasn't going in to potentially get refills, you know, along with some other drinks, and sometimes I did just pull through and get a refill. And so I feel like, you know, maybe without that additional perk, I would be inclined to visit less, which is what sort of like made me feel bummed out or like icky about the possibility of, you know, my normal routine and my normal day changing. And so it was just sort of like all of that were those were the things that I was like trying to say. Once again, it's completely my fault that the information got misconstrued and, you know, sort of thought of in another way because, you know, anytime there's something like this that happens, I feel like obviously it's my fault because I'm not expressing and conveying my thoughts and ideas in an articulate manner. And so I'm just firing off an anger and saying things that sound like I'm going to call the manager, which is douchey as hell. I'll be the first person to admit that. I feel like there's just been a lot of like, oh, you know, she was getting this, she was ordering this, whatever. So here is my standard Starbucks consumption throughout the day with the exception of, you know, like unicorn frappuccino, zombie frappuccinos, like specialty drinks, which I would get made just the way that they make them. Pumpkin spice, drinks like that, I pretty much get them just the way that they make them with the exception of I have to have skim milk because I'm kind of lactose intolerant. Other than that, my day in, day out tried and true is the regular like pitcher brewed black tea, like they make a giant pitcher of tea. What I actually get is a Grande black tea, but I love tons of extra ice and I also like to make it a bit weaker. So I add a lot of water and I put five pumps classic and then my coffee is pretty much the same way. It's actually a Grande in a trend to cup with a lot of extra ice, skim milk and five pumps classic. Oh, and a pink drink, but I get it made just the way that they make it once again, a trinta with extra ice. The only things I was ever getting refills of was the plain black tea and the plain coffee. No specialty drinks, no frappuccinos, nothing like that. Maybe this isn't like the way that all stores do it. Maybe it's just the way that stores in my area seem to do it, but whether you are getting refills inside the store, like you're staying in store or you were getting refills through the drive-through, they were always giving a clean cup, which always made sense to me. And I feel like that's where I saw a little bit more fallacy in this policy was, you know, I didn't really ever understand how it would be clean, which once again, I'm totally willing to admit that I'm ignorant. But even if you're sitting in store and you're drinking out of a cup, like you might be, you might have the flu, you know, you might be going to the bathroom and not washing your hands and like drinking out of your cup and then like passing it back to the barista, even in store to make a refill. So I always assumed and it has been confirmed that whether you were coming through the drive-through or staying in store, they were giving a new cup each time. Once again, that might just be things that happen around this area and not like their official policy, their global policy, whatever, I'm not well versed on that stuff. And I literally just don't go on the official Starbucks website, I just don't, I don't know what I can say about that. That's why it was like sort of silly in my mind that obviously, you know, and I think maybe they can even like look it up or see when they scan the card that like, oh, you were here an hour ago or two hours ago or whatever. And so that was sort of like the fallacy in my mind that this policy would be changed if they are going to give you a fresh drink and a fresh cup each time, whether you come through the drive-through or stay in store. Because it does sound like there's a lot of people who stay in store a lot and literally just drink like 12 drinks a day. I understand rules or rules, but I was literally just arguing from a policy standpoint that seemed a little silly to me. Once again, I might be totally wrong. I might be an asshole for thinking that, but that's literally just what I'm thinking about. Or that's how I see it. And you know, I'm not up in arms about it. Like I never really wanted to draw attention to it. I mean, I feel like if I was that up in arms about it or was that concerned about it, like Starbucks follows me on Instagram. And you know, why wouldn't I send them a DM? I think they follow me on Twitter. Like why wouldn't I send them a DM and say, hey, I feel so wrong by this whole process blah, blah, blah. Like I was literally just coming to vent about Starbucks frustrations, things that were irritating me. It was never meant to confront anyone or get anyone in trouble or anything like that. I was just literally coming to vent to you guys. Really don't feel like I have too much else to say about this subject. I mean, obviously I was in the wrong and I shouldn't have done what I did. And it's never my intention to harm anyone, but also make you guys feel, you know, uncomfortable upset or angry as a viewer. That's never my goal. I love to come here and just hang out and talk about whatever, you know, which is sometimes just venting and getting things off my chest. And it was just the wrong day to record it. I feel like this situation was sort of like a perfect storm where, you know, I was just very, I rate that day, like not only because of the Starbucks situation that was going on, but just also because of other things. And I feel like the person who communicated this to me, like didn't really get into any details. And so I just was like, and honestly, they don't have to tell me any details. But obviously, you know, I just feel like context helps. And once again, if I would have known then what I know now and the reasons for this and that and the other, then I obviously would never have felt that way to begin with, you know, I understand everybody didn't want to watch the whole video. I feel like it was towards the, you know, the end of the video that I said, you guys know I'm going to be back at Starbucks tomorrow. Like, literally, I feel like Starbucks is like, you know, it's a big part of my life. And you guys may make fun of me for that or think it's stupid or whatever, but it's something that I enjoy. It's just a simple pleasure. Honestly, really, I wish I could reach out to corporate. And honestly, tell them, like, what a good sore this is. And like I said, I feel like I was, I rate and there was some miscommunication that day. But overall, and I know people laugh at me and make fun of me and tease me for saying, oh, you know, baristas as friends, the positive things that I probably said in a negative way in the rant video about how, you know, I really do feel like they go above and beyond to create a welcoming atmosphere. I know that there's so many regular customers to this store. There has to be a reason that not just me, but many other people are coming in day in, day out, over and over and over and over again for that experience or for that enjoyment. Like I said, I'm really not going to dig any deeper and say, you know, all the things that I've been told over the years of why I thought that this was normal and why I thought it was policy. And I certainly did not think it was just for me and it was not. I feel like a lot of people are upset that I was talking about anxiety or depression. And by no means was I using it as an excuse for the way I was acting or as an excuse for bad behavior or as an excuse to be, you know, just gross and irritated. I mean, it's certainly not an excuse. I was just sort of trying to express at that moment at that capsule of time why certain things maybe were, you know, just, I feel like sometimes I just don't process things very well. And I am, you know, taking steps to better myself. I'm just saying things don't affect everyone the same way, you know, the way that anxiety happens for you may not be the same way that it happens for me. I by no means was using it as an excuse for bad behavior. I was just trying to tell you guys at that point in time, like where my mental space was. And sort of maybe some of the reasons that I was processing things the way that I was. I wasn't trying to say that, you know, I thought about I wanted to get refills because I had anxiety. Like that wasn't what I was trying to say. I can understand how it would be misconstrued that way, but that was not what I was trying to say. I don't have social anxiety. I have anxiety that's triggered by medical things. Sometimes those are things that I think or I feel myself that certainly are not visible to anyone. The road to bettering oneself has bumps in the road and you have to learn things. You've got to learn different coping mechanisms, better coping mechanisms. And I'm learning, but I'm not there yet. But I definitely did not mean to insult anyone or upset anyone by, you know, talking about anxiety or depression in that video. I was just kind of just ranting about all sorts of things. And it just, I mean, you know, anybody who's who's here for any amount of time knows that I just sort of like stream of consciousness it on this channel. Is it anybody that I've said or anybody who feels like, you know, these are my true colors. And I'm actually just a terrible rude entitled person. I can't change your mind. I can't make you like me. I can't make you subscribe. I can't make you, you know, it's up to you. It's totally your choice. I've had similar feelings about, you know, YouTubers or other artists or whatever that I love to watch. I have kind of a crappy saying, which is like, you know, stick around long enough. Like somebody's going to do something that disappoints you or upsets you. Like that's just how like we just don't agree on everything as human beings. Watch somebody or whatever. There's still going to be certain things that turn you off or just make you feel weird or creepy or that you don't like or you don't agree with. I think a great example for myself would be, you know, H3H3. I'm a, I'm an enormous H3 fan. But you know, sometimes he has said things that I don't like that puts me off that I don't agree with. But, you know, I stick around and you know, he always says other things or makes other jokes or whatever. I still enjoy the content. And that's just kind of the way that it is. I certainly did not mean or do any harm by it. I was literally just trying to get frustration, something that irritated me off my chest. And I decided to bring it to YouTube because that's what's normal for me is sitting down and making YouTube videos. You definitely won't ever see another rant out of me. I feel like I just never expressed them very well. And I just probably should not be doing them. Hinesight is 2020. And all I can do is try harder and be better and, you know, work harder on myself. I feel like that's all you can ask for anyone because at the end of the day, none of us are perfect people. I make mistakes and I'm sure you make mistakes too. The only thing that we can do is apologize to, you know, anybody who's involved and, you know, try and make amends and try and move on and do better. So, thank you guys for listening to me. I feel like I pretty much covered every topic that, you know, I could cover reasonably. I love you guys and I'll talk to you later. Bye."
028_Laura," Those eyes, in this video, has been so odd. This is possible. This is possible in all that I think has ever done. It's so sorry. It's so sorry you got it. I'm so sorry for disappointing you. It hurts me so bad. It disappointed you all who supported me for so many years. It doesn't have better than that person. I, six years ago, decided to retweet things that were so vile and hurtful. I was so stupid and ignorant and I have no excuses here today. I'm not here to give you an excuse. I have no excuses. I'm only here to say that I'm so sorry. I hope one night that you guys can save me for the woman that I am. I'm sorry. I can prove to you guys that I'm not that girl. I love you guys so much. Whenever I see I just support you, it just breaks apart into a million pieces. It's so sorry for anyone who has been hurt through this. Anyone? I feel so disappointed that I don't even like to look at myself because I can't even believe that I would retweet ugly things. And you know things that were hurt people like I can't believe I didn't see the pain behind that kind of tweet and that kind of behavior. I didn't see it. I'm so sorry. There's no excuse. There's nothing I can say that's the excuse I was just sorry. It's the best years ago. I wish I was a better excuse to go when I can't pray for the past. I can only pray for the future. I also want to say in this video that please, please just, if you hate me, please just hate me. People have called my mother and threatened to kill her. They've gotten her phone number. They've tacked a child. My poor girl needs to tack her. And I asked her, please just let this be me. Let this be about me. It's not about my family. It's not about me. It's not about anyone else. This is my sorry. There's another part of this story that like I don't know if you all know, but me and Gabriel and Nikita and Manny took a picture with our middle fingers up. And we were trying to mimic Kelly Jenner's birthday picture. And the picture was taken out of context. And it ended up causing pain for other people. And I just want to say I'm sorry to Jeffrey for the pain we may have caused you in this. I didn't know that that picture was going to be taken out of context and that anything was going to be said to you. But if it ended the day, it was done. So I need to owe you an apology for this. And I know we're not friends anymore, but I want to apologize to you. Thank you guys for giving me some time. And I hope you understand that I just need some time now. I love you guys so much. And I'm sorry."
029_Gabe,"Hi everyone, I'm Gabriel Zamora and thank you for watching. This video is definitely something I didn't think I was going to upload if I'm being quite honest. It's something that I feel like I need to upload now because there's certain apologies that I have to give, especially on video and there's certain things I want to further explain. I have now filmed this, this is my third time filming this. The reason why is because the first two times I feel like I was able to vent. I was able to really just let out my emotions and say how I felt like and just lay it all out on the line. And there were really long videos and I'm like, you know what? This isn't about just my emotions. It's about me just talking about what happened and clarifying certain things and asked to why certain things were done and kind of more of a backstory behind it. The first apology that I owe that I definitely wanted to make sure was in this video at the very beginning is to y'all, my audience, because I was the person that I didn't want to be and it was being negative, being petty and bringing negativity into a world that didn't need it. And for that I'm truly sorry and I've no, I've let y'all down because I let myself down. That's not who I should be. I started doing YouTube because I wanted to spread happiness and love and positivity and acceptance and just laughter. Like, I wanted people to have fun because that's how I looked at YouTube. I looked at it as like, this is so much fun. It's a great escape. It kind of takes me away from any stress that I have or if I'm just like bored and I just want something to entertain me. Like that's what I loved about YouTube. So the fact that I wasn't that, I'm truly sorry because that's not what I should be doing and for that I will take full accountability and I'm sorry and moving forward I don't want to be like that and I will work my hardest to not be like that. The second apology that I owe is for an old tweet of mine that resurfaced from 2012. I don't want to give you excuses as to what my train of thought was. Just know that it was ignorant and it was stupid and it didn't come from hate. I know a lot of people on the internet have said that I am racist based on that tweet. I asked that before you say those words, you now take time to realize what that means because I have taken time to realize that just putting out ignorance isn't going to help a situation because I've done that. So for that I'm truly sorry and I've learned from it and I hope that my actions since then have shown you all that I've learned from it and I've better educated myself. I want to link two videos down below just to further help the situation if one is still not fully cleared on it. One is just the backstory on how that word has come about and how it's developed over time. And a second video that I really respect is an author explaining why that word isn't for other people. And I've respected it since but I feel like this video is very straight to that point and it's clear and it's concise and I totally agree with what's being said in that video. I'll link that down below and just know that I understand that it's not my word and I've understood it ever since I was educated back then and I know it's not my word and I'm truly sorry that people still use that word and think that it doesn't have certain negative connotations and I'm sorry that I fed into that at one point in my life. I was ignorant and I was stupid and I'd take full accountability and just know that I'm sorry. I'm still sorry and I will keep saying I'm sorry. For that I'm truly I'm sorry. And the third apology that I do on camera is to Jeffrey. I'm sorry just for everything, not just for the tweets, not just for the photo, just for it all, just for allowing myself to create an image of someone based on what others were telling me and it's not fair because I wouldn't want that for me. So I want to go on camera and say that I'm truly sorry to you, Jeffrey because what I did wasn't intended to be bullying but I know now that it came across like that and I totally respect that and I'm sorry for that. I want to talk about the tweet now and I have certain things that I've written down that I want to clarify on. I don't want to edit this video so I just wrote everything down in my notes of things that I want to hit on. So let's explain, let me explain the photo, the tweet. So the photo context was just that a recreation of Kylie's birthday photo. It wasn't taken in a sense to bash anyone to try to disrespect Jeffrey. It wasn't taken like that. It was just taken to be dumb and funny. I then took it upon myself the next day to tweet the photo with that text. Nobody else saw this before I tweeted it. I just tweeted it. So when I tweeted it just if you care to know, just a little backstory on it was I was hung over. I rarely drink so I just said I'm going to drink this day and I woke up hung over as hell. There's no excuse. I'm just saying this is the mental space that I was in. So I was irritable. I was like just cranky. And then I'm seeing certain things online about Jeffrey doing this to my friends and I'm like okay, I just keep hearing about this person and I keep hearing this and I keep hearing that and I'm like why is someone who's so successful being so petty. That was my train of thought in that moment. And I'm like you know what, let me be shady on the internet. I'm one of the people that will, if I'm shady, I will own it because just don't be shady and be like oh no, it was an accident. No, like if you're being shady, own it. And I was being shady. I was being petty in that tweet and I tweeted it. Nobody else knew. So I have, I just want to go in timeline. When did everybody else find out? Nobody else found out? Well, I started to get likes and I started to get a retweet or like a response and then Nikita calls me and she's like what was that tweet? Like are you okay? Like what's wrong? Like what's going on? And I'm like you know what, I'm tired of this pettyness. I'm tired of this and I explained it and she's like okay just so you know it's very clear as to who you're trying to be petty towards and be like in that sense. And I'm like okay, she's like okay just so you know and I'm like okay. So when we leave the hotel, we get into a bus to go to a pool party and 10 minutes into the bus ride, it's brought up. So what happened on Twitter? And I'm like you know what, I'm just tired of this person constantly doing this to y'all because I keep hearing he does this, he does that, he does this, he does that, he's such a malicious person, he's so mean, he says I keep hearing these things and I'm like I'm fed up. I'm fed up. I keep absorbing all this negativity and I'm finally fed up. Like I'm over it. But this is also someone who's never done anything to me, never done anything petty to me. So I just finally had it and it's like okay we'll just so you know it looks like you know people are starting to like speculate as to who it is, it's pretty clear. Like it's really clear. And I'm like okay like and I made even more tweets, tweets that I definitely fluffed up because I was like you know what, I want to create a narrative and it's not fair and I now realize how that affects people because a certain narrative was painted about me in this whole process. And I'm like you know what, that wasn't fair and one shouldn't be doing that. Try to make someone seem some type of way to try to get people on either your side or try to see something some certain type of way. Someone should never try to tell people what to think or what to see or anything. People should be able to do that themselves. So that's when they're like okay we'll like certain hates starting to pop up. We get to the pool party and during that bus ride other things we're being talked about other negativity and we get on the we get to the pool party and we I'm still seeing tweets, I'm still seeing more and more and more things come up and it's like becoming a lot like even for me. Like I know I know I started it so I'm going to take I'm going to take full responsibility for it but it's like it's a lot. So during that process Nikita comes up and she's like hey like just so you know, like it looks like we all did this like it looks like all four of us were in on this and it looks like it's like we're bullying him. And I'm like oh crap and they're starting to get a bunch of hate because of my tweet and I'm like oh crap like this isn't fair for me to pull someone into this and I fully took responsibility and I apologize to my friends I'm like hey I'm really sorry because I drug you into this mess and I'm bringing you into this mess and it was like oh no it's fine it's fine we'll get through this we're in it together it's fine. I apologize to Laura I apologize to Manny and I'm like I'm sorry and it was very much the narrative of it's just really bad timing. So it wasn't it's not fair that you try to make it seem like we hate him. It was it's just really bad timing because of this docu series and everybody's on his side. And in my head I'm like well if you feel some type of way about someone irregardless of when it is is irregardless of when it is regardless of when it is you should still feel that kind of way. But I'm like okay you know what it's true I'm gonna just listen and take that and allow people to speak and if they're saying that and this is how they feel that's fine. I then go to Laura and I'm like hey I'm really sorry I don't know what to do in this situation I want to somehow start making this better what do you think I should do and she's like do you mind deleting that photo because even I agreed there was just a lot of accusations about her family a lot of just false accusations about her family and then it started to people start saying certain things about certain people and it was like is this true wait is this true I was seeing those responses and I'm like okay I totally agree I'll delete it she's like are you sure and I was like yeah I'll delete it I'm taking full ownership this is my fault I know what I started and I want to make this better that's why I deleted that tweet because Laura asked me after I offered how do I fix this let that be clear so then let's see everything was all right after that and why I took it down okay cool then we went to another pool and that's when we started to hang out that's when my old tweet came up and I voiced it to my friends it's like oh crap like there's now an old tweet of mine coming up and I'm being painted out to be as racist and I'm like I want to explain this because I've learned from this and I want to apologize to anyone who's being affected and I want to be able to explain this just a little bit further so they were aware I created my own apology I wrote it down I wanted to make sure that it was concise and I tweeted it it was it was my truth it was me apologizing for me owning up to it I know what I did it came from my social account I changed it on Instagram because I was like oh this is inappropriate but it had tweeted it out as well so I'm like okay just know that when you put something out on the internet it remains on the internet the reason a lot of people were like you're so stupid why didn't you delete this just so you know I've deleted that tweet twice not out of like oh my god like I don't want to ever get caught no because I learned from it and I was like oh wow like this shouldn't be on there even before I started social media I looked at all my tweets I was like could anything be taken as inappropriate because I'm not a malicious person I've never gone out of my way to try to bash someone in a racial way or in just in like a petty way in that sense so I'm like this tweet will haunt me I know it will because I've tried deleting it and it won't go away and that's fine I'll fully own up to it I've done so everyone was like you'll get it's fine we'll get through this right then that night I go to my hotel I decided not to go out I'm like this is just too much I'd rather just go to sleep we're leaving the next day our car comes for us to take us to the airport at like six or seven a.m. and I'm like you know what I should just pack just take a shower decompress and I was looking at comments and I was starting to like delete stuff and block stuff because I'm like this is this is becoming a lot like it's a lot so then the next day we're leaving and we're traveling back for two minutes okay I'm trying to like keep this short so then we come back we start going to the airport I get on to the bus I'm still not aware what's really going on with everybody else but Minky does like are you okay I was like yeah I'm fine and she's like okay like there's like just so you know they're starting to bring up like tweets on everybody like they're bringing every like all things of everyone up and I'm like like that's I didn't want all this to happen but when you put out negativity out into the world just understand that it will give it back to you what the energy that you put out is what you receive so I'm now trying to focus on putting positivity out and I'm learning from that because I've always been like that so I don't I regret that I allowed myself to become negative and I'm like okay so we have a layover in Amsterdam and then it's two hours and I'm like filtering comments and I'm like this is too much like this is a lot like it's it's now exploding and this is before at all and I'm like it's becoming a lot and I'm like it was it was taking a real toll on me and if I'm being honest I was trying to just become numb because it was it was a lot like I didn't want to think I didn't want to feel anything and I've had moments of just sadness and that just kind of like took me back and I know that I started this so I'm taking full accountability but in that moment that's just how I felt I wasn't really talking I wasn't trying to interact with anyone I'm just like this is just it's a lot like it's a lot so we then get on our flight back to the US back to LA and I just decided to go to sleep and I'm like just try to try to sleep this off or like try to like decompress like go to sleep just go to sleep and I slept for the majority of the flight and I wake up probably two hours before we land and 15 minutes into it my friends come up to me and the conversation has led and I'm going to be honest the conversation has led by Manny Laura chimes in everyone's and well Nikita didn't say anything and I was just watching it on assessing everything I'm like okay like what's what's going on the conversation has had of hey just so you know it's becoming a lot more and I'm like okay and we've been talking to our managers and our PR team and we've just been thinking of a PR way to handle this and I'm like okay and they have recommended that you take full accountability for the photo you apologize for the photo and you apologize to us for us not being involved and I'm like okay okay cool I tweeted it let's not look online stop so sorry about that so I don't like that it seemed that I was the only one who thought this I don't like that it was like oh Gabriel you're gonna take full accountability cool I did tweet it but let's not try to make it seem like other people didn't really think these things so I'm like okay cool but I will take full accountability I will take that I if I up I will take full accountability so it is then you're gonna have to apologize first this is all man Laura's like chiming in but one of the parts that kind of annoyed me was I wasn't given the respect of being looked at in the eyes while this is being had while I'm being told what to do so I'm like I'm starting to see these things I'm like okay read people's body language I'm steering at them and I'm not oh it's just I'm like okay cool you're gonna have to take full accountability your apology is gonna have to go out first so I would start working on it and and based off of your apology this person goes next this person goes next and I will be last and we all get we'll all gauge kind of like what the other one needs to fix and I'm like okay if you're sorry you're sorry just put it out there I don't I don't I don't understand why it has to be like this this this this and that's no like why are we why are we setting up others apology for success if you're you're sorry just apologize and be sorry so I'm like okay cool it sucks because I I felt like it was like okay like cool like I'll take full accountability and I guess I'll be the person who hates him online and I'm the only one who thinks this that's fine I know it and these are my friends and you need to do right by them so when I start heading home from the airport I get nauseous in the back seat on my phone for too long I'm already nervous I'm anxious it's a lot I don't even want to look at my phone I want to look straightforward and I just want to not throw up in this situation and I get a text message of from Annie hey how are you doing are you okay I just see it and I'm like I can't even respond like it's just it's a lot so I'm like sitting there it's like a 45 minute drive almost by the end of it I get a text message of hey I really hey we really need you to put out this apology because it's a storm for everybody else Gabby and I'm like wait didn't you just text me wondering how I am you don't hear from me and then it's hey we need cool okay interesting I'm like texting you back because your head space wasn't to see if I was good it was to see when am I putting this out cool so I come home and I write my own apology I wrote my own apology just so y'all know I wrote it yeah there was a revision so I wouldn't mess up but the only thing that was added was me attacking somebody else that didn't deserve it who was part of the Ipsy community that person definitely didn't need for me to but attack them the way that I did I was angry and she just stated an opinion it was a little bit sassy but it was her truth and I respect it but in that moment I attacked I didn't care I just attacked and she did deserve an apology and I was like you know what that's true all the other apologies apologizing to Nars apologizing to Ipsy apologizing to my friends apologizing to y'all to my community to the beauty community was me writing that out so Laura put out her apology first because she didn't want to wait she wanted to apologize and I respected that then I even had called her and I was like hey like I don't know like should I be doing a video should I be putting text out I don't know what to do and it's an apology is an apology you don't don't feel like you have to do something so that people can understand it an apology isn't apology as long as you are apologizing and you're sincere about it it's an apology and I'm like okay and I cried and I was like I like like I did I caused this for you as well I caused this for me and she and we cried and I put out my apology and I went to sleep that is everything with that with the photo and my apology what happened next was where I got upset that I was being painted in a different type of way so first Maddie's apology wasn't an apology because there wasn't an and I'm sorry in there his initial quote tweet of mine I wake up that Tuesday and I get a notification that he had quote tweeted me and I'm like wait what okay let me go to it thank you for owning up to it and all these things I'm like excuse me so I screenshot it because I'm like wait am I crazy thank you Gabby for speaking up we took that photo with the intent of recreating Kylie's 21st birthday picture with her sisters true the reason I liked it was because it was a photo of the four of us being silly the night before I didn't read the caption as I had been running around he was in his hotel just so you know when he was liking and responded to it maybe he was running around his hotel room that might be the case but you can't tell me that you didn't see a you didn't read that tweet it was a short sentence and it starts with the curse word and it's the photo of us for you're just gonna like something and respond to it no no no no no that's no that's not what we're gonna do and then once I was notified about the caption from you all I removed my like and asked Gabby to take it down as the photo was supposed to be a fun recreation and nothing more I was an asked by him to take it down when I said earlier I asked Laura how would you like me to better these things that's why I took it down let that be clear I would so that's why I'm like why are you now creating this narrative the same thing you do in every situation if we're keeping it a hundred let's keep it a hundred you know you feel these things let's keep it a hundred you feel these things somebody else does too okay other people do too so don't act like oh no like this no no no no no you feel that so let's not paint it out to be like I'm the one cool no no no great cool cool cool I'm getting emotional so when I read that I'm like messy can never help themselves when you're messy you remain messy so not only are you being messing your quote-tweet let me go look at what you've been liking and what you've been responding to so why am I seeing of course you did read the caption it was all fun in games until it backfired on the four of you it absolutely was not at all it was childish and I'm too grown for that honestly you're too grown too grown for what you constantly talk about him you constantly say all these things you constantly use people let's look at track records let's look at track records I don't have bad blood with anybody maybe there's one person that I and me and her have an understanding of we don't with each other but let's keep it respectful that's it she's not in this community so why are you the one who constantly keeps burning bridges and using people but you're too grown no you can't you say worse let's keep it a hundred you've said worse so my tweet that kind of said it all off was no no no manny stay up out of it and I and think about who your friends are he drug you down did a half-ass apology and no one is buying trust me it's been an eye-opening 24 hours is his response I looked at other tweets he was liking I wouldn't say friends with someone that put me in a bad position and created all this drama why are you liking this yeah I may have started this but let's not act like you don't feel like this if not worse because I've heard you say worse okay the 26 minute my camera shut off at 30 minutes I'll have to I'm just checking so I'm like interesting let me go look at if anybody else is being shady right now I go look at Anikita no because real friends don't throw out their friends under the bus even by throwing that kind of underlying shade there's multiple tweets that he liked so I was like cool so then Laura's responding to people me man Anikita didn't have any part of the tweet gave her posted we asked him to take it down and he did what do you mean we I asked you how do I better this and you said can you take that tweet down and I said yes let's not ask like I was told to do anything let's not act like that then she says I did not ever like or comment the photo manny did without reading the caption and within a few seconds he removed his comment unlike okay so you're defending someone and let's keep that clear she did defend him and was she didn't have to manny did but he took it down just so you're aware since your apology's gone oh where is he on this because that's your best friend okay cool so I'm looking at all these tweets and I'm like wow really like okay we're gonna play this narrative cool if y'all are out for yourself and you're thinking how do I better this for myself let me say face for myself and you're probably thinking well Gabriel you're probably reading into it maybe they didn't see those tweets or maybe they didn't fully read or maybe they're like just kind of like it's too much for them just so you know I know these people a lot better than a lot of you do let's let's keep it a hundred in the sense of I see how they move maybe I don't know what they did on their fourth birthday maybe I don't know everything about their family maybe I don't know certain things but when I see the move I am aware of what kind of person they are and to hear them constantly complain uh well this person like this tweet and it was shady about me constantly they've been aware for years that liking something shady is obvious that responding something shady is obvious they're creating that narrative and it's obvious these are my friends I saw them I see how they move so it's not me just misinterpreting things over reading things no because there was a lot of people online saying wait did you just throw him under the bus like wait didn't you also have a following out with him why is Gabriel the sacrificial lamb all these people are saying it tell him like okay I'm not crazy I am I am feeling these things with some reason oh it's at 20 minutes let me okay let me know so then I have to think you have to now not in the sense worry about yourself but realize what it is you want to do what feels right for you no longer okay let me not like certain things let me not do certain things let me remain hush hush so it doesn't add to the fire let me not add fuel to the fire so now I'm like you know what I wanted to apologize to Jeffrey that is an apology I wanted to create to give and I literally tech once I realize these things I'm like you know what you should be apologizing to him even if you've been kind of made out to feel like you shouldn't or that isn't your friend or this isn't a good person you should apologize to this person because you did attack them online you should apologize to them personally first so I wrote out a text an apology it was a long one and it went through and I got a response back my number wasn't blocked so there was a conversation had we spoke on the phone and I apologize for everything just allowing myself to create an image of someone in my head in a negative light based on what I was being fed because it wasn't fair for me to do that to anyone to hear all these things about someone and never have experienced them myself but still think these things about that person so I'm like I'm sorry for that I'm just sorry for a lot of things a lot of clarity came from that conversation a lot of things made a lot more sense once you heard once I heard the other side of the story I thought my friends are gonna tell me the truth that's not always the case so when he explains the situation that I thought why is he being irrationally angry it made sense why he was mad in this situation and this situation it made a lot more sense than I'm like am I am I being lied to why okay cool cool cool so I then tell him I'm like I would I personally would love to apologize online publicly to you I'm not gonna say I spoke to you I'm not gonna say anything I'm not gonna tell anyone I would just like to do that do you mind if I do that and he's like no I totally respect it thank you for that so when I created my apology I took me 24 hours I wanted to sleep on it I still wanted to apologize to the public but I wanted it all to kind of process in what do you want to do next Gabriel when I woke up I was like you know why there's a certain individual that I do need to cut out my life because it's always just been toxic a lot of the negativity around you and around your friends has been due to this one person there's the same factor in all these negative situations around your life because I've had a lot of friends and there's always these negative things going on and that seems to be the remaining factor and that's manny so I'm like you know why you're not that cool with this person if I'm keeping it 100 which all it wasn't that friendship was this weird narrative of after he's had all these falling out and so has she Laura we're just we don't really have friends let's just all constantly hang out and I'm thinking oh my god my friends want to constantly hang out like this so cool like there are some of the top people in the beauty industry and it's fun to just hear inside perspective from somebody else and these are also people who understand it I'm growing and I'm new to this so it's cool to just hear like inside tips and tricks like Laura has helped me so much with my youtube channel and my social media in general just giving me advice giving me tips giving me she's like my home is yours or whatever you want to do do you want to film like what do you like anything so that's her and Nikita have been the only ones that have really helped me I'm not saying manny didn't but he gave me a link to where I could get final cut pro like text and stuff cool there's been always like a hey you should be posting more and I'm like okay okay okay okay like I do want to post more but I've always been yeah I'm not consistent when it comes to posting but I'd rather post something that I love as opposed to me thinking I have to post and I feel like that's where I was going crazy me personally I'm not saying it was because of anybody else because I was like I'm going crazy I feel like I have to post like two to three times a week on YouTube and like every single day on Instagram and this and that I have to post a particular time because this is what I'm hearing constantly no I don't and that's where I was going crazy that's the only thing he's really helped me with so that narrative of we're all close kind of started to mess with me because I'm like I don't know anything about him really and he doesn't know anything about me but he's constantly hanging out with other people and having these close moments but I don't I don't get a hangout I don't get a phone call I don't get nothing so I'm like okay cool this is a person you need to cut out of your life you've been wanting to cut them out ever since he threw Laura under the bus when Laura and Jeffrey had that falling out he threw her under the bus let's keep it a hundred why is it that two people who were in the wrong with him only one gets out alive behind the scenes if I'm keeping it a hundred I was done with him I was like are you serious I see my friend and she is hurt she is distraught I'm getting emotional I wanted to cut them off it hurt because I felt like in that situation I was backing up a friend that I felt was hurt and then that friend then turns around and his buddy buddy and then I get pushed aside and I'm like wait I thought you were hurt and that's why I was hurt as well and then I was hurt that I was being kind of like pushed aside and I'm like what okay cool you can't be mad at someone's situation if they're not mad themselves and that took time during that situation for me to process but I'm like okay cool we try to better that situation it was talked over between me and Laura but during that time I did get an apology from Annie I'm so sorry that it just looks like this and I've hurt y'all and I've hurt my friend cool if you didn't throw her under the bus while you're apologizing interesting so when I wake up that day and I tweet out I'm sorry Jeffrey star I go to his tweet I copy and I paste what I also relate to it has been in I opening 24 hours because when he tweeted that the 24 hours that he was referring to was the flight and certain people's situations being come up like his insensitive snapchat so okay cool for me I saw myself get thrown under my narrative is being painted out as differently I have apologized to someone that I needed to and they have cleared up so much more for me so the next time like it has been in I opening 24 hours I wanted that shade you know why because as an audience y'all see it you see the shade I knew I've always been told you can manipulate the audience to think where you want them to sit on it oh my god this video is so long you can paint it out to be some type of way cool I wanted to be done I tweeted out he's trying to contact me I'm not responding I'm like I'm out it felt good it sounds dark but it felt good to just cut someone off like that I thought that cutting off a friend would be bad but it felt good and I didn't understand why but further realizing it's like that was a toxic person in your life you shouldn't have been friends with this person you shouldn't have been hanging out with this person to be quite honest because you really each other like that if we're if I'm keeping it 100 we didn't so I'm like okay cool so then I am follow him of course he freaks out because people are now catching on to it and he then sends me a voice memo that he's outside my building and it's like hey I'm outside your building you can't come into my building unless I allow you and you're on a list so of course he's not being let in so I get a voice my my mom outside your building I don't know why I'm here I just wanted to talk to you face to face I know you must be going through a lot we're all going through a lot what do you mean we're all going through a lot what are we all going through because it looked like I was I was only one going through it yeah certain people were going through things as well but I didn't tweet other people's things my photo I have now taken full accountability for that tweet I've taken full accountability for I have apologized to y'all publicly what do you mean we at this point because y'all are liking shady things it's no longer we and then he apologizes for liking and responding to things that he misinterpreted I'm tired of this I misinterpreted this oh I'm so sorry because of this oh I'm so sorry but it's because of this no if you're sorry you're sorry just keep it a hundred keep it a hundred with me and I will respect you yeah even if you were like hey I did like some shady tweets about you I'm kind of upset with you because you started that you shouldn't have but even though we all feel like this I was upset and I like these tweets and I shouldn't have I'm sorry for that I would have respected that because you know I'm like you know what yeah he shaded me but he is keeping it a hundred no don't say you didn't reach don't say these things when I know how you move I know how you work no we're not going to do that so I don't respond I'm just since then I have I tweeted that and I gave the respect of not doing anything more not liking anything more not tweeting anything not doing anything right so just seeing it all play out now that I feel like okay I apologize I'm backing up because what I did wrong everything I've apologized for right I'm contemplating a video apologizing to my audience and just that just apologizing maybe like still taking blame for that photo and not really going into depth like I'm going in now but to see someone go online and apologize to someone rightfully deserve he did deserve to apologize to that little girl but you're not going to talk about anything else you're not going to apologize to someone that has helped you get to where you are even though you've played the he offered it he didn't do things for me he didn't have to offer these things this is someone who's already so successful and you're freaking out because you're like I don't know where to go and I don't know what manufacturer to use and blah blah blah blah blah blah and your friend is like well I mean I can put in a good word for you in my place and I can give you these contacts don't act like this person and do nothing for you okay because even though I during that time wasn't the biggest fan of Jeffrey I always respected advice that he had given me one of the biggest advice was don't waste all your money that's going to be one of the biggest mistakes that you do coming into it I can give you any advice I did that and I blew through my money and I wasn't saving anything and it's true I was in the beginning starting to blow money I was like oh wow okay that's true I should be saving money so I always respected that and I respected certain things and certain critiques and certain advice he would give me and I would say that I'd be like he's a smart business man maybe I'm not the biggest fan of him but he's a smart business man I would say that but don't go online and not apologize to the person who's helped you the most the most because a lot of people have helped you and I will always say who's helped me I'm not gonna say right here but you can go to my previous videos you can go to interviews that I've done and I give credit where credit is due I'm not here today off of my own blood sweat and tears so many people have helped me get to where I am and I give credit so don't go online and that give that boot type of video because yeah that girl deserved to be apologized to but then you're gonna apologize for an insensitive snapchat that was brought up during this and you're gonna mention his name in the video and not apologize to him cool but when Laura's apology came out and she was dragged through the dirt dragged through the mud because you got a lot of hate for not responding to that and she made sure to include it in hers you weren't anywhere to defend your friend but there's a tweet of her defending you at one point there's your best friends trust me that when someone with my friends as y'all have seen I go up to bat but when I saw nobody was going up to bat for me publicly even though I had one friend in that group help me behind the scenes be like hey you did this tweet and it's bullying but I'm here for you and I want to make sure that you're good I heard that one friend only one friend was aware that I have never dealt with this this is a lot for a person to deal with and that person's checking on them because that's right or that so when you don't defend your friend online even though you probably did the worst to be quite honest because you sucked that friendship dry and then you try to get out for like get out safe but this person I remember got the biggest hit so when he attacked her and you got out safe who's house did you go to right after that to go apologize to let's keep it a hundred I'm tired of this narrative being put out that someone is so sweet and someone is so good when behind the scenes I know so much more and I'm going crazy because this image is being painted out and it's being well received as you're good no your friend was just drugged to the dirt I know for a fact that Laura isn't a malicious person does she do stupid things yes but I personally in my experience with Laura know that she's not a malicious person but I'm not going to go up to defend her because I didn't get no defense you were liking shady things I'm not defending you at this point but your best friend isn't going to defend you and it's going to allow all this while you get the biggest hit and you're losing the most when in actuality you didn't do as much as he did cool it's been an eye-opening experience if I'm being quite honest this is a long video and I'm sorry it's this long but it just it's my truth and it's I know I'm venting a lot and I'm I want to just wrap it up at this point I don't want to convince you on anything don't let me tell you how to feel don't let me tell you what to see allow others to show you who they are look at it all look at it all and really realize who these people are because I try to keep it a hundred and I allowed myself to not I made myself seem like I was like best friends and like all this and I did hate this person as well no I'm sorry for that to myself and to y'all because it's a lot dude I guess a lot it's a lot it's a lot it's a lot to just process in I hope that this video put some clarity as to me and my truth and my experience I know I've been to it all and I'm sorry for that it just it's it's just built up and don't forgive me because I'm asking you but just look at me moving forward and maybe you need a break from me and that's fine but if in a month and two and six in a year you come back and check on me I hope that my actions have proven that I've grown from this and I've learned from this and that's all I can ask for if you no longer want to be a fan of me or be part of my social family I completely understand that because I let myself down so I know I let a lot of people down because I saw those comments of I always thought you weren't gonna be petty or dramatic or problematic that's one of the reasons why I was being so nervous and scared about this video it's not because I was scared of anyone it was because I was scared of looking as problematic when I didn't want to be like that but all these things are going on online and it's all started from that one tweet and I want to now clarify a little more from my side because there's a lot of assumptions out there as to oh he probably did this or they were all in cahoots with that tweet or this and that know like I want to clear a lot of things up and I want to apologize to y'all because I was petty and I was negative and I allowed myself to be there and I'm sorry for that it's a lot I'm still gonna take more time to just allow this to fully process and because I feel like I can't just just click a switch in my head and be done with things sometimes a universe forces you to start and you chapter even if you think you're not ready you have to move forward with it and I have to move forward with this and I know that I've been the past and I want to learn from this and I want to take time to really reflect and just cleanse myself and I've been talking to just friends that I haven't talked to in a while I've been talking to family I've just been really just assessing the whole situation and seeing where I went wrong where I stopped and I'm sorry for that like I truly am that I'm not the best version of myself as ever recently I'm not and I want to take time to just realize that allow that to sink in and see how I can better myself moving forward for me and for y'all because I'm not going anywhere I'm not gonna just quit I'm I love what I do and thank you to y'all for allowing me to do this it just feels good to say it it truly does to just put my truth out there I just I feel like weights just lifted okay I don't want to further discuss this I'm not gonna disable my comments if there's any other advice you can give me when it comes to better educating myself I would love to hear it you can write that down online I know I'll get a lot of hate still and that's fine because this apology isn't for it to be accepted and for me to be the good guy again and for me to be liked again it's for me to explain my side and hopefully certain people can see that this is my truth and this is me being honest oh my god it feels good thank you"
030_Manny,"Hey guys welcome back to my channel my name is Mani Amiway for those of you who might not know who I am Thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it So today's video is a video I should have made a lot earlier and I should have addressed things a lot sooner. So last night Gables of Moira uploaded a video titled My Truth and it was a video about The situation happened last week about a photo that me Nikita Laura and Gabi were in flip using or flipping off the camera being like this With the intention that photo was intended to recreate Kylie's 21st birthday photo You know, we took a bunch of them and then we were just fucking around after because we're all friends And that's what we were just doing. We're just like, you know And he spoke about him riding this narrative that he that we had no idea that this photo was going to be posted And it was going to be used in the context that it did that is very true. We didn't I watched Gabi's video And first and foremost before I even get in to the video I want to apologize to Gabi because watching that video I can see the hurt in his eyes and I understand where he's coming from 100% and looking back I would change things if I could if I could You know Gabi said Mani You know mani showed up at my house wanting to talk It's true. I did I texted Gabi asking how he was how he was Once I realized What I had done as a person as a friend to him I texted him right away. I called him I voiced him with him. I drove to his house. I tried My best to rectify a situation that I fucked up in and I know that I fucked up I was still so hurt and so upset and so mad So mad at the fact that this photo even went up in the first place And my mind I thought how could a friend do this to us how could a friend do this to me? How can he put up a photo like this with all of us writing his own narrative? It was selfish in my head. I was thinking it's selfish There's no way he would do this like this is not something he ever would do And I was in denial and the reason I haven't talked about this photo or apologize for this photo was because I was being Prideful and that's just the fucking fact of the matter. I was being prideful and I thought myself I didn't do anything wrong It was a miscommunication. It was a misunderstanding. Why would I apologize for miscommunication that I had no part of and I didn't know what was going up but looking back at the situation I Did have a part of it. I was involved in it. I was in the photo. I liked the photo and The fact that I was part of it in any way should I perform is What I Needed to own up to I wasn't I wasn't allowing myself to own up to it because I was being so fucking prideful And I was like no I didn't post this. I didn't know it was being posted. That's not fair. Why should I? Why should I apologize? You know I didn't do anything wrong. I have no quelms with Jeffrey. I don't I let Jeffrey live his life and Live it happily if I would have known that photo was in the use for what it was used for I would have never done it I would have never posed for that photo because I don't want to Come across negative and do these things. That's not what I wanted. I didn't want Jeffrey to get hurt I wanted to feel bleed in any way shape or form That's not what I wanted Gabby also talked about in his video about a pattern a pattern that I have and That really hit hard That really Fucking hit hard to me because Him talking about my track record, you know talking about the other relationships in my life, you know talking about Look at the things man he said look at his track record look who he is as a person You know If fucking hurts But seeing that It's the truth it hurts, but it's the fucking truth Sorry, I'm getting a little intense Gabby was talking about a pattern that I have with my friendships, you know, and he's talking about two Frenches specifically and he's talking about Patrick star and he's talking about Jeffrey star and he's talking about himself of course as well and That's what it is I have had bad track records with other friends of mine in Private yes, but they were still bad track records in in itself You know talking about Patrick for example Patrick Introduced me to the beauty world. He was the one that really got me into it He's the one that inspired me. I have the looks on my Instagram still to this day that were inspired by Patrick You know Patrick is someone who I was so inspired by and we became friends and we grew together and we learned from one another And we were so close we were so close But just like friendships that happen every day of our lives We had miscommunications we had missteps. I heard him at the end of the day friendship is a two-way street. I was internally hurting as well You know and Due to the fact that I am a Terrible communicator and the fact that I am So bad I conveying my emotion to my friends And real life because I want them to be happy. I want them to like me You know, I want them to see the best version of me possible. I don't want to ever talk to them in a negative way. I never want to Have them see me in a bad light and so I would rather push them away Than me have a confrontation with them. I am not good with confrontation in the slightest I'm actually fucking terrible at it and This situation that's happened Has really brought it to light to me that is what I've done. Patrick was hurt by something I did You know by our friendship and what happened between us And for that I am sorry. I'm sorry to Patrick You know me and Patrick I Hold no ill will to Patrick whatsoever. I've made videos on his collaborations I've talked about his collaborations whenever I see him I hug him. I say hello You know and even though we aren't close like we once were I still wish him the best I truly truly do And And if I could go back in time And help mend my relationship with Patrick You know have us go through our dark times. I would do everything differently I would be a better communicator. I would tell him things that We're affecting me and we're hurting me and I would open up and not just internalize them and have a fucking meltdown In my mind I would talk about things and talk about my emotions and my feelings because in turn Me thinking that walking away would save the friendship and turn Destroyed it and destroyed all my relationships in that way You know not owning up to my bullshit That Hurts people So now regarding Jeffrey this is a big a big topic This is something that people have been asking me and asking me and asking him for so long to talk about as to why we are no longer friends Why are we are no longer close what's going on between us? What's the tea what's going on? There were things mutually done to one another that hurt the other you know and the fact that we Didn't communicate that to each other better It's Truly where I feel like our downfall was was our lack of communication and the fact that we didn't we were not able to communicate to each other how we were truly feeling You know Jeffrey has done oh my goodness. I can't even explain Jeffrey has done so much for me in my life You know I would I would would not be where where I am today without Jeffrey Jeffrey has helped me in insurmountable ways He truly truly has and just like Patrick if I can go back and Fix things with Jeffrey. I would I really really would Because How he felt how he feels It's alright. It's like we never had closure. You know last year Me and Jeffrey had a heart to heart um around November and I went over to his place and we wanted to talk about certain things You know we wanted to talk about things of why we were in this weird funk but I Wasn't able to open up like I wanted to and I wasn't able to accept The things that he was telling me I wasn't able to accept it you know and I take full responsibility you know for that and for me not being a better communicator and for me Not believing in him when there were certain things that were going down You know at the end of the day too The things that have happened between us all those are things that have happened between us You know, I never wanted to take this to social media. I never wanted to talk about this, you know These relationships that I've had with these people These people that were in my life and I loved so much These were private things these were things I never wanted to talk about these were never things I wanted to speak about because That was a relationship between me and Jeffrey not many of you weigh in Jeffrey's star It was between me and Jeffrey. It was between me and Patrick. It was between me and Gabby Those were things that I wanted to keep private and hidden You know and yes, even though we had our differences and we had our Miscommunications and we had our missteps and we are no longer close like we once were Those are mutual understanding that I didn't want to go out and publicly bash anyone and talk negatively about anything Have I been shady along the way and like with tweets and likes and things like that? Absolutely Everyone has all of us have You know and that's just human nature to be petty And being a fucking bitch Honestly being a fucking bitch and that's what I was I was being a fucking bitch You know you guys I have not reached out to Jeffrey about this situation. I've not reached out to Patrick about this I have reached out to Gabriel and he shut me out and that's okay because he's hurt by something that I've done And I understand that and I take full Fucking responsibility for what I did to him and hurting him by liking tweets by responding to things you know that I Can't even explain how mad at myself. I am about this Because that's the last thing I want. I don't want to lose a fucking friend. I don't want to lose another friend That's the last thing I wanted You know, which is why I was trying so hard to mend it and fix things But I understand I understand if Gabby does not want to fix things. I understand that is Him that is his truth and he if he's happy without me when his life then so be it And so be it But I have not reached out to Patrick and I have not reached out to Jeffrey yet I didn't want it to seem like it was disingenuous like I was only reaching out because Of all this shit coming up now You know, maybe in the future We can talk with Patrick for example I just saw him at Vidcon recently and it was a great experience. We took photos together and it was great We just talked and just sat and chilled You know and that's what I want you know, we might not be best friends We might not be close anymore But the fact that we actually have a working relationship now and we're able to see each other and be genuinely happy when we see each other That is what I wanted and that's what we have And with Jeffrey the reason I didn't apologize or talk about it soon Which because I really and my bones felt I had did nothing wrong I did not post this photo. I did not know this photo was being posted. You know, I liked it unlike it And my pride got on the way and I didn't reach out to Jeffrey and I didn't talk to him You know and That's what happened. You know, we might not be as close as we once were But he is living his life happily and I'm living my life happily And that's all I want recently Alicia Marie posted a video and it was about like the the dark side about YouTube and just kind of talking about with other influencer You know what talking about The other end of YouTube with other influencers and in that video I literally say How grateful I am to Jeffrey for introducing me to a lab that I use I do not wish any ill will on Jeffrey or Patrick or Gabriel. I don't I want them to be happy I want them to be happy You know, even though I was a shitty fucking friend to them You know, maybe that's why I want them to be so happy because I was Because I Because of my own shortcomings as a person and as a human being to them Because I wasn't there for them And I was a shitty friend You know looking back looking back at everything Communication is everything you guys it is everything when I tell you that communication is the most important thing It truly is you need to be able to communicate in a voc your emotion or else you will not be able to flourish in relationships And I really feel like that was a big downfall in all three of my friendships was Gabby Jeffrey and Patrick I wasn't able to convey how I felt And that's a big reason why it ended and why I slid back And why I took a step back from the situation. I was like no, I would rather You know step away then confront them and Tell them how I'm feeling You know you guys confrontation really brings out a bad side of me and by that I mean my anxiety And my depression and confrontation really brings my anxiety to a whole new level And I think to myself if I'm not confronting this person That's hurt me It's fine because I'm not going to be feeling anxious and I can just kind of back away and I can try to mend their friendship from afar But it never gets mended because I swept it under the rug I swept it under the rug and that's what it was I swept all my friendships under the rug because I Wasn't able to talk about them even making this video right now. I'm shaking It's so hard for me to talk about these things. It's hard to talk about You failing as a friend. It's hard to talk about you failing as a human And it's hard to talk about you failing to your audience And that's what I feel like I feel like I've failed you. I feel like I've truly failed you guys so much And that's the last thing I want is to fail you guys You know you guys this has been one of the most Life-changing things that's ever happened to me in my entire life Is this situation that's happened to me You know it's it's made me re-evaluate Who I am as a person Who I am as a friend who I am as a sibling who I am as a son You know and I've talked to my parents about this you know I'm at my parents house right now actually this is why I said it looks a little weird Because I've been here for the past two days just reflecting and talking to them You know my parents even told me Those tough love oh tough love is a very real I Asked my parents what they thought of me and what they think about the situation and what They think in general and they say that I've changed My own parents told me that I've changed And hearing that was so heartbreaking You know then tell me that I've got swept up in LA You know swept up in the numbers and the views and the subs You know and I feel it and I know that's the truth You know and that's why it hit me so hard is because I know it's the truth I started social media when I was 21 And I wanted to do it because I was a little scared gay boy who was just coming out of the closet Not knowing what to do who loved and makeup that's why I started social media in the first place Now that I'm 27 it's gotten to us such a different level You know and I feel like I've been losing myself in this I've lost Who I was when I was 21 and I lost and I know I've grown and I've bettered myself along the way But some of the changes I've made have not been for the better You know and that means me changing for my parents to tell me that I've changed and they worry for me every day And they pray that I don't get swept up in LA and that That was A wake up call to say the least Because Your parents are never going to sugarcoat anything for you. They're going to let you know what the fuck is up And they told me that and I was not ready for it. I was not ready to hear it But I needed to hear it. You know, I needed to hear I needed to hear I need I Need for people in my life to keep me accountable You know and even though I was hurt by Gabby's video. I needed to watch it I needed to see how he was feeling because I didn't know I didn't know how I was coming across to him You know, I didn't know that he felt that way about me and I didn't know he felt hurt And now watching that video I know That he felt hurt and he was upset and he was Devastated by what I did to him and he felt alone and he felt abandoned as a friend And watching that I completely agree Singing from his view and his lens That is 100% true. I would have thought my friends abandoned me as well That wasn't my intention But that's what happened just like the situations with Jeffrey and with Patrick. I never meant to hurt them I just didn't know how to communicate with them that I was hurting as well and This has been a huge like lesson to me you guys at the end of the day I need to take responsibility for my actions and the things that I do And for the human that I am and who I'm becoming That's why I'm making this video. I need to take responsibility for myself and as someone who's in the public eye I Should know better. I should be better than what I am right now. I should be so much better For you guys for my audience for the people that love me for the people that care about me for my family for my friends And that's the reason I'm making this video is because I want to own up To my shortcomings as a friend and as a human and as a person You know in And you know thinking about it I'm disappointed in myself But there's no other words to say other than the fact that I am truly Disappointed with myself in this situation and I understand that you guys are disappointed in me and I get it Because I'm disappointed in myself and I'm disappointed how I've treated my friends because They didn't deserve that and that's not what a real fam does They're by your side 100% I'm still by deep real side. I'm still by Nikita side. I'm still by Laura side And I love them And I wish I could take it all back, but I can't and I need to own up to what the fuck I've done and my responsibility So you guys I'm gonna be taking a little break and just really Reflecting on myself and And Sing who the fuck I've become you know why Why have my priorities changed? Why am I in social media now? Why? Who do I want to be? What do I want to do with my life? I those are the questions I need to ask and I need to be answered for myself as a human And as a person I need to know those things and I don't know those things right now You know Like I said, I felt like I was getting lost in the views in the subs in the cloud and I was like oh it doesn't matter I can Do something later because I just needed to film this video real quick first You know, and that's a big struggle of mine and that was becoming the only struggle of mine You know, I wouldn't neglect going to see my family in San Diego I haven't been in San Diego since December And It was because I was so focused on being L.A. being manly and you like being this Person who continuously uploads and kills himself to get content out and you know always trying to find the next best thing and wants to get likes and views and subs But this situation at hand has really helped me realize What's important? You know, and that's my family and that's my health And that's you guys I have a lot to work on as a human and as a person and I do try my best that I can say for a full Open heart and open mind Hand to the Bible to God. I do try my best to be the best person that I can be But sometimes it's not enough and you need to do more And even though in my heart, I know that I Thought I did what's best in every scenario that I was in That wasn't enough and people got hurt and for that I am sorry. I'm sorry that people got hurt You know, it's never my intention, but that's what happened And I take full ownership of that and that's why I'm going to go on a little break right now You know and really just do some soul searching and figure out who I want to be from this and I will be back stronger And a better person and a better friend And a better human from this so I love you guys so much more than words can describe truly You guys have been there for me when People in my life were not when my family was not and I hope you guys Will be here for me through this as well and if you can't be I understand I do you know, I failed you And if you Feel like I'm not someone you want to follow anymore. I understand I truly do and I want you guys to know that I'm going to continue to do my best because that's all I can do is try my best So um Thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you guys when I'm able to see you guys"
031_DeFranco,"Stop you beautiful bastards. Hope you have been a fantastic Monday. If you are here for your regularly scheduled Philip DeFranco show, I apologize so much. There are so many things happening both in this country and just the world in general that I want to talk about that I think we need to talk about. But unfortunately, I've been on the receiving end of just ridiculous accusation after ridiculous accusation regarding better help. People saying I'm this mastermind scammer who's running a Ponzi scheme. I just need to address this bullshit before moving forward. I usually do not stop for every barking dog, but this has gotten to a situation that is just ridiculous. Also, in addition to the people that regularly watch this show, the people that are coming to this video just to shout that I'm a scammer, and I should go kill myself, and all the lovely things I've received over the weekend. You, all I ask of you, is for you to put your hate in a little box for a second, listen to me talk, and then and then feel how you feel afterwards. And also, if everyone in general I apologize if I end up repeating things, I know I talked about this last Thursday, but I think just in one dedicated setting, it's important that I hit on all the notes since for some reason, depending on who is talking about this story, certain parts are excluded or glossed over or exaggerated or misconstrued. And so with all that said, let's talk about better help. They're an online counseling service, I've used it, I've loved it, I've made no secret whatsoever that they've sponsored my videos in the past. And today, and awesome, brought to you by betterhelp.com slash de franco. I hit that note because certain versions of this story involve me sneaking in some sort of sponsorship, which is just not accurate. And how would that even make sense since my name's literally in the URL? Also an important part that has been excluded or glossed over by some telling this story, I immediately suspended my sponsorships with them moving forward. And I announced that last week when I first learned the concerning language in their terms and conditions. I immediately suspended new sponsorships and I immediately reached out to them for a comment. And if you want to see their full response and what the concern for many was, you can watch once again that full Thursday video. But essentially the TLDR of the response is that betterhelp has a team that is dedicated to rigorously vetting the counselors that use the service. As far as the concerning words in their terms and conditions, they said that this was essentially legalese, legal language that was meant to limit legal liability. And also adding that they would modify it moving forward. And while I believe them and I'm aware that could just be my own personal bias, I still suspended new sponsorships moving forward. And as I mentioned Thursday, they will not be returning unless one, they change those terms and conditions to a place that makes me feel overwhelmingly comfortable. And two, I go to their offices in person, speak with their team, in person, see their policies and procedures in action. Additionally, I want to talk to them and get responses in regard to a variety of complaints and accusations against them. Also on top of this, a thing that has been excluded or glossed over by several of the people telling this story, I have involved a third party journalist. And the goal is either for them to go with me to the betterhelp offices or independently. Obviously a lot of that depends on availability, scheduling, but the main point is getting the access and checking the whole situation out. And the reason this was such an important part for me is I am aware that if I was on the outside looking in on this situation, I would question my objectivity. Also, I want to address some fantastic new accusations that have come up from what has been deemed a gotcha moment from my Thursday video. I've seen accusations ranging from Philip DeFranco actually runs betterhelp or he owns part of it or he's invested in it or he's the mastermind behind everything. No, none of that is true. As I mentioned last week and this has been used as a gotcha moment here, I'll play it. Betterhelp has been a sponsor of our videos, we've even partnered with them at a company level to help them with other sponsorships with other YouTubers. And so that clip has been misconstrued as, oh, that's the smoking gun, that is the evidence that Philip DeFranco he is invested in is part of that he is the mastermind. No, and I'll explain this situation a little deeper. So at the beginning of this, I had my original sponsorship with Betterhelp and it was just a win on all fronts for us. It was a sponsor that I personally used, thus a sponsor I personally trusted, it also brought in, of course, a sponsor, brought in money, and unlike pretty much any sponsorship before, after I would do those spots, I would actually get messages from people thanking me for doing the spot. Some because they either personally enjoyed the service or they recommended it to a friend or family member and it was working out for them. And two, some others just seeing us onboarding a brand like BetterHelp as just taking away the stigma from talking to someone about what you're going through. And actually, also while we're on this note, a popular narrative that has moved forward is that just everyone from the get-go, they were like, oh, BetterHelp's a scam, you look online, just people complaining. And of course, like with any service, there are going to be bad reviews and some pockets of the internet, there could just be overwhelmingly bad reviews. But if you search, and I searched again this morning, if you search BetterHelp reviews, first when the pops up has 287 reviews, 4.2 rating, e-counselling.com, 90 reviews, 3.9 rating. And then, if you search for a trusted trust pilot, 7.3, additionally on the BetterBusiness Bureau website, it has a customer rating of 4.4 stars, and it actually has a BetterBusiness Bureau rating of A+. But once again, understand, I am not defending what was in their terms and conditions. That is also concerning to me as a person that used the service. And so to create this narrative, that there was nothing but bad things being said about this company, it's very transparent of what a fucking hit job some of these pieces are. Also, there have been people claiming that I'm praying on the mentally ill. No, and in fact, if you scrub through the bad reviews while there's a variety of reason. As far as the two main complaints, the first one was people being charged and it was being connected to a free trial of BetterHelp, which on that note, our sponsorships are integrations with BetterHelp, they are not free trial memberships, it is a purchase, when you go through the process, you get a page like this. But then also too, you had some people leaving bad reviews because they were being turned away from the service. And this is an important note that I want to hit on because it's not just that BetterHelp turned them away. If you look at BetterHelp's response to individuals like this, they recommend an even link to help you find face-to-face therapists. And they also link to incredibly important resources like crisis hotlines, suicide hotlines. And in fact, to read an email that someone received, they were complaining about this. BetterHelp said to them, we determined that online counseling with BetterHelp may not be the best option for you. Online counseling is still new and is not the most effective form of therapy for everybody. However, you deserve to get the best help possible and seeking for help is certainly a step in the right direction. We recommend considering traditional face-to-face therapy and you can find many available therapists in your area by clicking here. And then adding, if you are in a crisis or if you need immediate help, please look at these resources. And so what you see with a situation like that is BetterHelp could make money off of that person if they want it. But instead, the company opts to give that person the resources to deal with their specific situation. The situation that is more serious may recall for more serious measures. We all do not have the same issues that we're working through. The main point through our experience was a good product and sponsor with a good purpose and it was well received. And so following this success, the positive reaction I negotiated a deal with BetterHelp to make it so that I could also connect them with other YouTubers like an ad agency would. We connect some content creators, we set them up, we handle their daily numbers, we make sure they get paid. If they have any questions or need any help, we can be there for them and then on the other end, BetterHelp, if they have any questions regarding, do you think this person would be good or something along those lines we can advise? And for all of this, like an ad agency would, we take a percentage of the sponsorship. As far as why we would want to operate as kind of a small third party ad agency, is that's been a small goal of our company. As I mentioned before, we had the sponsor that was just seen as a winner on all fronts. And at the same time, I knew of several creators that were having a hard time finding sponsors for their fantastic content. And so it just seemed like a no-brainer that we would take this win on all fronts, connect those people, we'd handle everything for them. And then like an agency does, we take a small percentage for the connection and the upkeep. And this part dives even deeper into our long-term business model. It's been a side goal of mind having in-house sales team have essentially a small agency. I mean, everything we do is crowdfunded through to Frank O'Elie. It is self-funded, we go out there and we make deals with brands. And so part of our business model moving forward was that, you know, we've done so much legwork to have direct connection to brands rather than working through other agencies. So what if a new part of the company expanded what we're already doing with our existing sponsors and brought it to other fantastic YouTubers? For example, and I think this is something that started the whole snowball effect. We need to go see the Shane Dawson's deal with and for him and his team. And that's why our company's name shows up when you go to Shane's link. It allows us to be able to provide him with daily conversion numbers, you know, how many people are signing up. Also, and this is because there's been a point of confusion with there also been users like Boogie2988. He was unsure why my company name was in his referral URL. And the reason for that is instead of going to him and several other creators directly, which can take a lot of time, you don't want that agency to feel like you stepped on their toes because this whole business is all about relationship. And so we just went through an agency we already knew that he had been working with. And so just like we do with the creators we work with directly, we provide that agency all those numbers for him. And so part of our company here operates as a third party at agency and they're providing a service for all of these people. And actually on that note, I want to mention because once again, they're people saying that I'm the mastermind, I'm the one behind everything. No, we are just one of several that are going out there and connecting with people. For example, even though people have been attaching me to the integrations, I didn't connect David Dobricks crew like Jason Nash or others like H3H3 and L Mill. Now with all of that said, as far as what is next, what is upcoming? One, this morning, the founder of BetterHelp wrote a really long, medium post about everything that has transpired. In it, he addresses the terms and condition problem as well as other accusations that have been made. And as far as what is next for me, I currently have our team just scrubbing through accusations and complaints. The reason for that is my goal is to try and get to the BetterHelp offices and speak with the team as I mentioned this week. And also on that note, if you have personally used BetterHelp, you had a bad experience, you have not been completely refunded. If you can provide any sort of evidence that what you're saying is accurate, I would love to bring those specific situations up to them. And so I'll include this email right here. In addition to everything else we're doing, my team and I will go through those as we prepare. And that's because I want to make sure your valid concerns are heard that we get answers. This is an extremely important thing to me. But with all of that said, that's where I'm leaving this situation. Once again, if you're one of the people that came specifically to dislike this video, say horrible things to and or about me, that's fine. If anything, I just appreciate you for giving me the time because it's very easy to just hear something and then hate. And also to everyone else, once again, I'm sorry that this is taking the spot of a regular Philip DeFranco show. My goal is that Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday will have a regular show. Friday, it is incredibly unlikely that we'll have a piece. And that's because even without this situation, my personal schedule is an absolute nightmare this week. But also now because this BetterHelp situation is a priority, I'm going to try to get to their office this week. But with that said, of course, as always, my name's Philip DeFranco. You've just been filled in. I love you faces and I'll see you tomorrow."
032_Britt,"Hey guys, I'm not really sure where to start this video. I am scared to film this video. There's some things on the surface that have come to surface that have come to fruition that need to be addressed. So I'm here to do that and I'm here to put everything to rest. I was in for all, I did write a statement and so I'm going to be reading that, but I'm actually filming this video the same day that it's going to be going live so I'm not going to be doing any edits or anything of that nature. I am just here with my heart and my sleeve and I'm here to put everything like I said to rest once and for all. I apologize to anyone who feels like they got scammed for me and I genuinely promised that my intentions from the start were pure. I wanted to help and impact as many women as I could because I felt like this is why I was given this incredible platform. When you're given an opportunity like this, you would be stupid not to take it and run with it and unfortunately I ran too fast for one person. These claims are coming from years ago after I got launched into a business that took off so fast that I didn't know how to mentally handle it. I did what I needed to do to the best of my ability. I didn't know what I was signing up for simply because being an influencer and running a fitness influencer business was not really a thing back then. Therefore I didn't have much guidance. I'm not truly saying this as an excuse to my actions but to give you all a much seated explanation as to why certain things happened the way that they did and fell through the cracks. At times it got extremely overwhelming and it took on more than I should have and for that I take full responsibility and I am sorry. I am so so sorry from the bottom of my heart but know that I am human and along with that I have an incredibly big heart for people and a passion for what I do. When I was offered the opportunity to help women all around the world, I jumped into this head first to something that at that time had it been quite tapped into yet. My arm was still very new as was the influencer world and I just happened to be one of the first to see the opportunity laying right in front of me. As I said, looking back I had no guidance and how to run my business as a fitness influencer, much less on how to respond to negative comments aimed towards myself or towards my business. I was not only a coach but also the sole content creator, customer service, business owner, YouTuber, financial advisor and everything else that comes with every business. I now realize that I should have had more help and that this is the lesson that I am having to now learn the hard way and for that I can and I am sorry. But like I said, when you are passionate and set on fire for what you love helping women, it's easy to fall into the mindset of I can do it all on my own. I want to make this right not so that the harassment will stop but although I really hope that one day it will but because I realize how much this has impacted you guys, I want to address each of your concerns about your experience while working with me. With that being said, I created an email specifically addressing all complaints and I will list this email down in the description box below. Please email me with your name, the email you originally used to work with me and your proof of purchase or receipt. I will address it as quickly as possible. Many comments below will also be handled via email so that we can talk through your experience and work with me. Months previous to this, I had actually been in contact to resolve an issue with a sweet girl who was a previous client of mine. She had brain cancer at one point in time, we talked through things and now I am so incredibly blessed to call her a friend. The only reason that I bring this up is to make a point that in fact does show that I as a business owner and doing things to the best of my ability to resolve any issues that may arise. As an influencer, I understand that I have the full responsibility to show up even through the threats and the harassment. I would please ask that all death threats and all of your threats are once and for all put to an end. I would also ask for you to please leave my family and my friends alone. Again, I am so sorry. I am so sorry for any harm that I have caused anyone and I hope that I can do what it takes to make things right. I don't know what else to say. To be quite honest, my brain is pretty frazzled right now. I wrote this last night and I just... I promise myself it wasn't going to end at this video. So this is just the real raw. I am planning on posting this tonight. I don't really know what else there is to say. I am so sorry and I am sorry for anyone that feels hurt or scammed by anything of this nature that was never my intentions. Like I said, my intentions have always been pure. My hardest for people, my hardest for women and to help and sometimes as a business owner, when things take off when you're young, this was years ago, you think you can do it all. And now knowing now, if I knew what I know now back then, would have saved me a lot of problems. I am here now, years later, having to apologize and wanting to apologize and asking for your forgiveness to move forward and learning from my past mistakes. Like I said, the email is going to be listed in the description box below, but I really hope that this just puts everything to rest one last and final time. Yeah, I just please ask for you guys to leave my family and my friends out of this and for the death threats to stop. In the past 24 hours, I have literally received hundreds of death threats and that is just absolutely unacceptable at this point. I'm sorry. Again, I'm sorry. I am a human. I am a human being just trying to be in this world, just like anyone else and I make mistakes. And that's what this video is here to do to address it, to say that I'm sorry. I realize I messed up and I'm moving forward. And I just hope that you guys can appreciate the fact that I'm showing up yet again to be extremely vulnerable and this is extremely difficult to do and I'm doing it and I just want to make things right. Yeah. I think that's it."
033_Yovana,"Hi fam. Hey guys. I don't think there was ever gonna be the perfect time for me to make this video. I definitely did not feel ready to talk about this or share it. And first of all, I just want to say that I'm really, really sorry about the way that the news were communicated to you. How you had to find out. I know that so many of you, you trust me, you listen to me, and you probably feel deceived and lied to. And you're in your whole right to feel that. And for that, I asked for forgiveness. I'm human. I made a mistake. And I was not planning on hiding this from you. I was planning on telling you, but on my terms, on my time, it's been a process for sure it still is. It still is difficult. I'm still in the process of admitting and accepting to myself the changes that I've had to make in my diet because of health reasons. And in this video, I want to share with you what got me to this point because it's not just something that happened from one day to the next. It's something that has taken time for me to come to this point. But before I start that, I just want to say how much I stand for the plant-based diet and for veganism. I believe it because I felt it. I've experienced it six years ago. I'd adopt any raw vegan diet. I learned about this magnificent way of eating plants. Let food be thy medicine and your medicine be your food. All of these things I learned six years ago and they completely changed my life. Because of this plant-based diet and veganism, I was able to overcome addiction like alcoholism and smoking cigarettes. I was able to gain a greater consciousness of who I am in my place in this world and the foods that I need in order to thrive and everything. It's just it elevated my consciousness and body, mind and spirit. And because of that is because I decided to start a blog to start my Instagram page and my YouTube channel and share this with all of you because I wanted to share this message. These good news. This thing that I had found, I felt so incredibly good. And that's how it all started. So because of that, I'm also grateful to this lifestyle because if it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here with you today. I wouldn't have shared all of the things that I've shared with you throughout the years. I was vegan, completely vegan for over six years. And it's been two months since I started incorporating eggs and fish into my diet. And I just want to be completely honest and authentic and truthful with you guys today. That is just what I've been and I want to continue to be that transparent. Before that, I just want to say that I believe in this diet that I can heal people. I believe that it's an amazing diet that many people thrive on and that I have thrived on for years. And something happened to me in my health that led me to have to try another thing, another solution to feel better. So I will get to that soon. Okay, it all started six years ago. This was when I found out about the plant-based diet. I found out about the Robby and Diet and that's how my journey started. I adopted Robby and it's in for the first two weeks. And I felt amazing. I did juice clenzes. I was feeling a lasting society. I didn't want to drink. I didn't want to smoke cigarettes. I was sleeping better. I was feeling better. I was looking better. My skin cleared. It was amazing. It was beautiful. It was, I had found a hidden gem and I didn't know. Why don't people know about this? Why isn't this information out there? So a few months into it. That's when I decided to share my journey and I decided to share this. At the beginning, this was just getting started on social media. This was 2013. So people were just starting to talk about Robby, Gynism and Gynism and Plant-based diet on, you know, to the masses. And in Spanish, actually, there was really no one talking about this except for me for a long time. So I started to find all these people that were doing this and I was like, my gosh, this is amazing. Like, this is a lifestyle. This is a way of living. This is, yes, and I was so motivated to keep on going and I continued on my journey. And the more I continued, the more I got just involved into the lifestyle and I wanted to learn everything about it. I took courses. I became a health coach, certifications. And I was really into this raw food, raw vegan diet and just I was getting into it. It was amazing. And a year into my journey, I decided to do a 25-day water fast. So I fasted for 25 days. Yes, I only drank water for 25 days. I don't know how I did it, honestly, but I did it. And it's been one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had in my life. And I felt like I resetted my whole body. I just felt amazing. I felt on top of the world. My energy levels were beyond. I was winging up every single day at 6am, going for runs. I was eating at the time a low-fat raw vegan diet. But one thing that did happen after my water fast was that I lost my period. By this time, talking to other people who were in the movement, they're like, no, it's normal. It's okay. You're still ovulating. You're just not bleeding. I even thought that it was a good thing at one point. So that went on for two years. I didn't have my period for two years. Until the end of 2015 was when I started looking more into it and talking to more people and reading about it. And I learned that not having a period is really not healthy. It's not good for you. So I said, okay, well, I'm going to go and get checked and see what's going on. So I went to some doctors, their naturopathic doctors here in San Diego. And I began to get blood thrown out and tests. I did, I remember I did a urine test to check my hormone levels. And when I received the results, all of my hormones were out of whack. Actually, they were premenopausal. Like if I was a premenopausal woman. And this was really weird because I felt good physically, but the numbers were wrong. And I wasn't getting my period. What I've learned is that whenever there is disease in the body, it doesn't just happen from one day to the next. It's like a gradual thing. It's a build up of things that eventually you get something, you get a disease. Even though at the time I was feeling fine and it was good physically and I had good energy levels, something was going on in my body that wasn't right. And eventually it was going to catch up to me and eventually it was going to get worse. So it took me a little bit to really understand that and see the seriousness about it and that I needed to do something about it now. Or I was going to pay for consequences later on. So I began to change at my diet. I increased my fat levels. The doctor said like you need to eat more fat. I added salt into my diet because I needed minerals. That's around the same time when I started to eat cooked. They weren't related the two. I started to eat cooked because I was craving cooked food. Maybe it was also because something was going on in my body that was telling me like, hey, you need more things. So then I started to eat more fats and added some cooked food. And within two months I got my period and I was really happy. But it was very irregular. So I never knew when it was coming. Someone's it came. Most months it did come and I would get my period for two to three days. So it was light and I just told to myself, it's just my body healing. It's going to take time. It was years that I didn't have my period. So obviously my body needed time to heal. So I was patient with it. This was all of 2016. And it was in 2017, the middle towards kind of like September or something. When I stopped getting my period again in 2017. And it was around five months that I didn't have my period. When I got to the point that I was like, okay, I need to go and get checked again. Something's going on. I'm not getting my period. I think also part of why I wasn't getting my period was the stress. So I can stress very easily. And I don't think that helps at all. And I don't think that that has helped at all during this whole health journey that I've been in. I went to that checked again, got blood drawn out. And I got back the results. So by this point, my hormones were still not good. I wasn't ovulating. I'm still not ovulating. I was basically anemic and my thyroid levels were low. It wasn't really bad, but it was borderline. So the doctors, they recommended that I take testosterone and that I take a thyroid pill. Ever since I started to go with them, they would always say you need eggs. Just eat some eggs and you'll be fine. And I was like, no, I'm not going to eat eggs. I can do it with the plant-based diet. I always knew that doctors would recommend that, but I didn't pay attention to it. So the doctors were like, you need to, first of all, you need to gain more weight. You need to take that testosterone, the thyroid medicine, and these supplements. And also, it would really benefit you if you ate some eggs. So I was like, no, no, no. So I said, you know what? I'm going to seek out some different information and talk to someone who actually understands my diet. So I talked to a doctor and my friend, who's a nutritionist. She's specialized in hormones. So I talked to both of them and told them what was going on in my symptoms. And they said, okay, what you need to do is get an iron supplement. So I started to take iron. Also, eat more protein, eat more fat, like really track how much protein you're getting. So I started to track my macros and around this time I was also talking to a friend who was giving me my workout plans. And I was tracking my macros, trying to gain weight and gain muscle. And I was super motivated. I was like, yes, this is going to do it. I'm going to get better. And I was also taking some Chinese herbs to help me regulate my period. So my goal was to gain around six, seven pounds. The doctors would mention a lot. Like if you gain weight, a lot of the things that you have are going to get better. So gain weight. It's also like, I'm going to gain weight. And I did gain weight. I did. I gained around six pounds. And I got my period back. And this time it came back good. Like I felt it different. This time it came back more regular in the sense that I was getting it every month. And I was getting it a little bit more heavy than I was before. I was bleeding for around four days instead of two or three. I was really happy that I was getting my period consistently. And it just felt really good. So that was going well. And then during this time though, I was moving. So I was in San Diego moving to LA. I was unstable physically because I was moving from one place to the next. I lived in four places in three months. I was going back and forth through Airbnb's. And when I got my period was in April of 2018 when I moved into my apartment. So I think that had a big part in it because I was under stress because I wasn't stable. And once I got to LA to that apartment, I feel like a lot of my stress went away. And I got my period. And I had been doing everything right. I was taking the supplements. I was eating more protein of fat. I was taking my herbs and working out and tracking my macros and making sure I was eating enough protein. And I was feeling better and I gained the weight and I got my period. So I was like, okay, this is really good. I said, okay, now I think it's time to get my hormones checked. This was around June. I started to see a new doctor. She was a naturopath. She understood my diet more than the other doctors which I really liked. I felt safe with her and at that time I was feeling physically a little more tired. I was beginning to feel more tired. I think the beginning of 2018 was there was like good things going on where I was getting my period. But at the same time my energy levels were just not good. They were decreasing which was kind of weird. Like I couldn't, I would film a video and I would get feel really tired after that. Or even my workouts. I just took a lot more effort for me to get up and actually do them. So I did notice that but I didn't really pay much attention to it. I always thought that it was, I was traveling too much which I was traveling a lot. I was traveling. I probably wasn't sleeping well. So I was like, okay, I'm going to maybe change my workouts. I never considered that too much at that point. It was July of 2018 when two things happened to me. One thing was starting to happen to me and one thing was another thing that happened to me. I got Candida and it wasn't like a normal Candida. Usually you got Candida and you got and you're in testin. But this was agonitis Candida. So I got Candida in my vagina. I know it's so weird. I had never heard about it. And the way that I noticed it was because I was getting cuts on my vagina. And it was really painful and I was really scared. So I went to see the doctor and as soon as she saw me, she did a test. They did like a swab test to see what it was and it was Candida. So I did the Candida diet. So I started on that and basically the Candida diet was a diet low in sugar, low in fruit. I completely eliminated kombucha from my diet. I didn't eat grains. I was basically just eating veggies and fats and tempeh. I was also taking some supplements and some herbs for that. And that went away quickly, which was really good. It went away in about a few weeks. The symptoms went away. But it was it was bad. It was painful and I was traveling during that time. And it was just very uncomfortable. But I did get better and then I went to get tested again and it was gone. So I was happy about that. But around that time was when I was also starting to get some digestive issues, which is why I thought that I had Candida in my digestion, in my intestines, and also vaginal. Because I was starting to experience these digestive issues. And these digestive issues were that I was getting very, very bloated from basically anything that I ate. I was feeling constipated. I was getting diarrhea. I was having a lot of gases and a lot of burps. But it was on a very small level. It wasn't very big as how it eventually got to be. I told my doctor about these symptoms that I was having. And we already knew that I didn't have Candida. So she said, I think you have SIBO. This was like towards the end of the summer. And which is really ironic because a lot of good things were happening in my life at that time. And I was getting engaged. I was getting married. And it was like all these good things were happening. But then at the same time, physically, I wasn't feeling my best. Which was unfortunate. But I think that all the good things that I was feeling were more than the bad thing that I was physically that I was feeling bad. So I paid attention to it. Obviously, I was treating it. But I try not to put too much energy into it. I was focusing on getting healthier, on doing what I needed to do, and not worrying about it. So during this time, well, I was before I got, I did the SIBO breath test. I was trying out different things. I would try eating raw for a week and seeing how I felt. And I thought, okay, this is what I need to cleanse to just get reset my digestive system. Or I would do juice cleanses. I would do water fast. That was the best. I felt really good when I did water fasting. Because I wasn't eating anything. I got to the point where I just preferred not to eat. Because I was afraid that anything that I would eat, I would feel sick after it. I also tried intermittent fasting. I said, okay, intermittent fasting is what I need to do. I tried that for a while. And at the beginning, it would work. So I was just trying a lot of things. And eventually, I said to myself, I just need to eat balance. Just eat your protein, your fat, and your carbs. Just eat balance in every single meal. Eventually, I did the SIBO breath test. It's a test that you breathe. And then it captures your breath. So I did that for two days. And the diet that you have to do to do that test is basically a protein of fat diet. You can't eat anything that is fiber. So I basically didn't eat anything. I ate white rice, which that's one thing that you could eat. So I did that test. That was at the end of October. But I didn't receive the results until early January. Because it took like 30 days for me to get the results back. But then Thanksgiving and Christmas came around. And everyone was, you know, the doctor was gone. And so I didn't get my results until the beginning of January. By this whole time, I was starting to feel desperate for my health and to find a solution around the summertime. And that's when I started open up to the possibility of adding some animal product into my diet. And it was really hard because for so long, I saw this food, this animal food, as something that is basically toxic for my body, something that I don't need, that my body doesn't need. And to see it as something that it could heal me was really hard for me to, it still is hard for me to accept and admit or even consider at the time. But I was warming up to the idea of it. I hadn't even received my C-Vote test results. I hadn't even, I had gone through the Candida. I had gone through the, I was starting to go through the bloating issues. And that's when I started to consider it. When I received my C-Vote test results, which was early this year, January 2019, I was relieved to be honest that I knew what I had. I knew that I had C-Vote. But at the same time, I was confused on what to do. I didn't know. I wanted to do the right thing for my health. To be honest, I thought about the future. I thought about it that if I don't take care of my health now, what's going to happen? It's going to, you know, it's going to come at me harder. I thought about the fact that I am a woman and I want to bring a baby into this world. I want to have a family. If I'm not good, then how can I expect to bring a child into this world? All these things were going on in my mind and thinking of the reasons why I wouldn't eat animal. It's because I have stood so strongly besides the plant-based lifestyle. So when I received the results, I had already been researching about SIBO. I already knew what you needed to do to heal SIBO. And this doctor, I really like her because she never pushed eating animal. And that, I think, really helped because whenever someone pushed that to me, I felt very defensive. She said, you have two options. One is you can follow your vegan diet. These are the foods that you can eat. So the SIBO restricted diet, the one that you have to follow for the first four to six weeks, is a very restricted diet. You can basically only eat from veggies. It's buck choy, eggplant, kale, carrots, and a few other veggies. Other veggies you can eat them, but on measured amounts and some nuts and seeds, no fruit, no potatoes, no sweet potatoes, no legumes, no grains, and protein, animal protein, and fats. So she said, this is the diet. And I looked at it and I was like, okay, well, I would not be able to survive on that diet if I was eating plant-based because it was basically just kale. I wouldn't be able to survive on kale. I would only worsen my diet. She said, you can follow this and take this powder. It's a supplement that you take and you substitute it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, or whenever you're hungry, you just drink this powder. By this time, I've taken a lot of supplements. A lot of supplements. There was one point when I was carrying around a big bag of supplements everywhere. And I eventually stopped taking those supplements because I felt like they weren't doing anything to me. And then I would get tests and nothing would change. Anyways, I was researching on the best brands, the ones that I will absorb better, taking different things that, you know, I know that if I take vitamin C, I can absorb certain minerals better. So I was pretty much sick of just taking powders and taking supplements. I didn't want to do it like that. And the other option was following the SIBO diet and adding some animal protein into my diet to substitute what I wasn't able to eat. Because basically what happens when you have SIBO is that your body can't digest fiber. And as you know, the plant-based diet is mainly focused on fiber. Everything has fiber and fiber is really good. But when you have SIBO, fiber is really bad for you and your body can't process it. Which is why I was feeling so bloated and I was having a digestion and diarrhea. Whenever I ate anything because it was full of fiber in my body couldn't take it. So this was my reality. And it was like for me, being in that moment, I was like, hey, this is real. Like this is really happening to me. It's not something that I can just ignore. It's not something that I can just let pass by. It's here, it's present. And if I don't do anything about it, then I'm going to be getting the same results. So I gave myself the opportunity to try something else, to experiment. And this was really hard because of what I believed for so long, because of what I preached for so long, because of the responsibility that I feel as someone who has a voice and who speaks. I decided to put my health first. For a while, I hadn't put it first. And I wasn't considering all of the options. And for me, it was now an option. I was seeing it as an option. And that's exactly why I hadn't shared it with you. And for me, it's still an experiment. For me, it's still a process. I'm still figuring it out. I'm not going to sit here in front of the camera and tell you like, oh, I've been eating eggs in fish for the past two months. And everything is better, and everything is good. And the plant-based diets doesn't work. No, I'm not saying that at all. I am saying that I am trying to figure it out. And I want to, I really want to be able to go back to eating plant-based. I want to be able to just feel that good from eating plants and be a testament to that. It's been really hard for me to accept and admit it. So that was two months ago. And for the first three weeks, I kind of following the diet. First of all, it was difficult for me to eat that because I felt a lot of guilt and shame. And even just the taste and the textures of it, I wasn't, it's not something that I really enjoyed or was into. But I was seeing it as medicine. In the past, I never ate eggs. Like, I never liked eggs. And thinking about where they were coming from, of course, I was sourcing them locally. And organic and cage-free and pasta raised. And really researching on what I was buying and what I was eating. So that was the first three weeks. And then I found a doctor who she's a plant-based and is a gastroenterologist. So I wanted to see her. And I wanted to see what she had to say about SIBO and what diet to follow and what protocol. And she suggested to take the antibiotics and to follow a vegan diet. Throughout this whole time, I haven't taken antibiotics because I want to heal the most natural way. And the biotics, I don't, I believe that they don't go to the root of the problem. They will relieve my symptoms, but they're not going to get to the root of the problem. So, you know, I'm, as I said, I'm still in this process, this experimental phase. And maybe I will be open to taking antibiotics, but I didn't want that to be my first option. So she recommended that. And she said, you can eat anything. The SIBO diet is what they, you know, it's not true. You can follow a vegan diet just don't eat fruit, no raw. And that's it. So that's what I did. So for the next two weeks, I was like, okay, I can eat vegan. Like maybe it's all in my head. And so I eat, I started to eat 100% plant-based, which was a lot of fiber foods again. I wasn't eating any gluten. That's something that she recommended. But the symptoms came back even worse. One of the weeks it was around five days that I was constipated. I literally did not go to the bathroom for five days. It's when you feel bloated and when you can't go to the bathroom or you have diarrhea, it's not just something that you feel there in your digestive system. It's something that affects your everything. It affected my mind, my mind felt foggy. I didn't have energy. It affected everything, my mood. This was when it was getting bad. I'm a positive person. I always try to stay positive and look at the positive things. But it got to a point where I thought that maybe it was stress, but it was obvious that everything that I ate, whenever I ate it, I just felt sick. So I went back to the diet. I went back to the SIBO diet. And it's been about a month now that I've been, or less than a month. It hasn't even been that long. That I've been following it to the T. For like a very good first week, I was feeling a little bit better. It didn't even take that long. It only took like five days for me to actually feel better. But two weeks ago was when I really, really, really started to feel a lot better. I'm feeling like myself again. I feel energy again. I feel good. I don't feel bloated. I feel, I could go to the bathroom once or twice a day. And it's just been amazing. I'm so grateful for that. And that is where I'm at right now. I wanted to share this video with you and just be honest and upfront until you exactly what is going on. This is what is going on. I wish and my hope is to be able to go back and eat the way that I love to eat. I am grateful for this opportunity to improve my health. I'm grateful for taking the route of self love. And I feel that I'm doing this out of self love because I want to be better. Because I want to be healthy. And because if I'm not healthy, then I have nothing to give to this world. We came to here to serve. And how can I do it if I don't have health, if I don't feel good? So essentially that's what I've done. I've taken emergency measures. And this is what I had to do. It's not something that I wanted to do. Another thing I want to say is that this is my personal experience. This is my body. Something that I've learned is that everybody is different. We all go through different things. We all need different things in different stages of our life. And I've learned how important it is to be healthy and to put my health first. I just want to say that this has not been easy for me. It's been very hard for me. What is going to happen with me, with Ravana, I want to share my journey. I love sharing my journey with you. I feel that everything that happens in my life is for a reason. I feel that it's to share. And with the hope that it can help someone out there. And maybe someone out there is going through what I've been going through. And I hope that this video also marks a different way. This video also marks a difference in myself and my channel. There's so many things that I feel sometimes I don't share. Because I'm afraid of what people will think, including this video. I want to be stronger in my voice and what I believe in. And be more upfront and honest. And I want to be more upfront with you. And clear. I think being in a relationship has really helped me with learning how to do that. And how to communicate and talk about everything that I think and how I feel. And I want to do that with you too. Because I feel a connection with you guys. It's been so many years that I've been here. And you are a big part of my life. And I see you as friends. I see you as I know that you are a person, a human being behind the screen. And we are all human. I want to really listen to my body. And I want to be a testament of health and pass on the message of health and of love. Thank you. Thank you for listening. And thank you for watching. And thank you for hearing me out. And thank you to all the people that have messaged me and support. I have honestly not even gone on social media to see the comments. I was just focusing on this video to be as authentic and open as I can possibly be. And for you to truly feel that for me. And I know that it's going to take time for my body to heal. And I'm going to be patient with that. And I would love to share more of what I'm doing to heal and the process of how I'm feeling. No judgments. And be able to openly say you know what? Right now I'm not feeling good. This is what is happening. Or right now I'm feeling really good. And this is what is working for me. Or this is not working for me. And without judgment, I really want that. And I think all the people that provide that safe space for me to do that here. I love you so much. I love you. I only wish the best for you, for me, for everyone. I'm so grateful to have you in my life. And I will see you in the next video. Bye. Bye."
034_LaBrant," Hey guys, as you may have seen my name has been associated with an Ashley Madison account website made for spouses who want to have an affair I'm here to clarify some of this with you guys because I owe it to you I did make the account. I made the account two years ago This is an issue that is in our past This was before I got onto YouTube I've brought this to my church at the time when I first started the church that I'm at now this has been brought to my discipleship partner This was brought to my wife's attention. She's she has forgiven me for this mistake that I made and opening the account I've sought forgiveness to God and he's forgiven me so I've been completely cleansed of this sin and And also I need to be clear that I've never met with a single person face to face through that website and that I never had an affair With anybody ever well. I've been married with Nia The account was open out of pure fleshly desires and just simple curiosity some of you are questioning my faith and Me being a Christian and doing this and And I guess what some people don't understand is that we're all broken even Christians we come to God as broken people and He has sent Jesus on the on the cross to save us from those sins and because this is in our past and this has already been Completely resolved within our family and within my church We won't be saying any more of this matter. I won't be talking to any media outlets the only place you'll hear of this out of our mouth is here on this video the only time no this is why we need a savior we're sinful by nature and we do stupid things like this and This is what the Atomans all about forgiveness and second chances and I just want to add to guys You know I have forgiven Sam and I stand behind him This isn't our past and it's unfortunate that it's being dug up right now, but you know our marriage is worth fighting for and it always will be And I just want to encourage you guys who are dealing with any kind of Situation like this within your marriage to just fight for what you have marriage is the real deal and it's been sealed and It's worth fighting for it always will be All right, and thank you guys so much for your support the one standing by us and believing in us and We'll see you guys tomorrow God bless"
035_Sousa,"Alright guys, this video is not going to be to waste your time or to hear anything else than what you want to hear. And before I start this video, I also wanted to say that this is me not what's so ever trying to bash Tanna or go at Tanna or do anything towards Tanna except the best. I mean that's true from my heart. What had happened in our video is true. There was a little bit of over exaggeration to some of it, but I mean what she was going through and what I have done, I mean I don't blame her for speaking you know just her mind and her truth and her heart to go honest with you so. Coachella Weekend was very bad both weekends. People have it twisted saying that I cheated on her during the weekends that's not true. That did not happen. I never physically touched another girl during our relationship ever. I did Snapchat a few girls from back home and they did send me nudes. And I replied I did. I was you know drunk, stupid, didn't realize what was going on regardless. I'm an idiot. Every single day I just wish I could just take back what I did because I really regret answering just these stupid pointless people that gave me absolutely 0% of what Tanna did for me and the love literally everything like that girl is perfect. I obviously wanted to make this video so that you guys could just hear me out. You know again I'm very sorry for what I did and I regret every second of it. I should never answer these stupid ass people. I just want to make sure that Tanna is the happiest person ever. Me and her still talk. It's not like that and I would never I mean unless she wanted to hate me not talk to me and I would totally get that and I would wish her all the best. But I'm very happy and glad that we can still keep in touch here and there. More of this whole story is don't take people for granted because Tanna wasn't literally my own side world and I feel like she still has and she always will be in my heart forever. And I just good to say that I've definitely learned from my mistakes and it's something I would never do again. I feel like there's no one else I could do that to you even though she was like everything. And I probably will never in my entire life meet someone like her ever again. She's one of a kind that's for sure. She no matter what people say or do or anything she's literally just well she gives her all for everyone. If there was one last sip of water on this earth and she was with one other person she would literally just give it to that person because that's how big of a heart she has. From here on out I hope that you know people kind of take this video as not only an apology but as a lesson if there's anyone out there it's just not worth it. I just want you guys to know that I'm truly sorry and I love you Tanna forever. And I hope that maybe one day we can fix things just like you said you know. I mean only time can really tell. I'll always love you and you'll always be you know place right in my heart. And if there's anything you ever need you know I'm always here. No matter what it is even if you wanted to talk or do whatever you know this though I'm just letting everyone know that. I'm an idiot and I'm saying sorry to not only the love of my life Tanna but to you guys. I feel like I owe everyone an apology because it's not even like I'm just hurting the love of my life. It's like you guys too you know but yeah I just hope you guys can watch this video and understand my full listeners and you know. Whoever has ever been the same boat realized that it's stupid and don't ever do it. And yeah thank you for taking the time to even watch this video. I also want everyone to know that like regardless of what it is it's still classified as cheating. Even if you go and you know do something physical or even answer a girl snapchat no matter what the end of day it's the same thing. You know that's going against your partner and going and doing whatever with another person that's not okay. Regardless I just want you guys to know that so don't take when I said I didn't do anything physical that matters at all. Because at the end of the day it's still pretty much doing it is doing the exact same thing. It doesn't change anything. So anyone else that's watching this video don't ever think that that's okay either. I just want to thank you so much and again for literally everything that you did for me. Even the way you did care for me like you cared about that with everyone especially your fans and friends and family and literally everything. Like a homeless person to call up to you off the street and be talking to you for three minutes and you know you would end up doing the most crazy shit for them. Because you just have the biggest heart and it's literally made of gold. People make mistakes and I'm very sorry for it. I'm in the wrong. She did absolutely nothing but gave me the well. I just hope that you know exactly how she said in her video and I'm going to say in a minute I hope that we can both you know just grow from here and keep going and learn from mistakes that happen. You know everyone makes mistakes not nobody everybody's not no one is perfect in this world. Sorry and at the end of the day you know I'm just a human being."
036_KSI,"Alright, sorry that this video's taken so long to come. I was on tour when my brother's video came out. So, before I start this, I already know this is a loose-lose situation. There is no winning, only losing, especially on my end. I have made plenty of efforts to try and sort this situation out privately, but well, I guess that's just not happening anymore. Obviously, this is very serious, so I'm going to refrain from making any jokes in this video. I've attended C2LARF at things in bad situations as a way to cope or see the bright side, but I need to stop doing that and face this head on. Also, personally, I don't think content like this should be monetized. However, I'm going to be putting ads across this video and putting all the money made from this video and giving it to various suicide prevention charities. For reasons, I'll talk about later in the video. All the charities I'm going to be giving the money to will be the description down below. I also want to ask you guys not to pick sides or switch sides so easily, or just jump on the bandwagon because of one video. Myself and Deji have both made mistakes, and the best scenario is for both of us to succeed. So, please refrain from unsubbing or sending hate to Deji. That being said, I'm going to go through every point my brother has made and essentially defend myself. So, looking back at the videos we used to do in 2012, obviously it started innocent. The games you were playing, I was just laughing, it was funny, it was literally a bundle of fun, it was content for you guys to enjoy, it was hilarious. So, obviously, it all started off with just an innocent slap, a few Q&A's like slap Deji. Slap Deji. Oh God, what? Oh, oh, hell no! And all that stuff, it started off innocent, obviously I saw the fun side of it too, because at the time it was funny. Everybody found it funny in the comments, everyone was just having a laugh. But through the progression of those videos that we did on my brother's second channel, slowly and progressively, it started to get more violent from throwing controllers. You need a piss off! Fuck you! To throwing bottles. Belks. Oh, you're in your pointless. You're in your pointless. I don't know. You can't belt me. You can't belt me. You can't belt me. I just want to put on my belt. You can't put on your belt. I just want to put on my belt, because my trousers are full. Give me my belt. Give me my belt. Give me my belt, Nico. Even chairs. I'm big bit, I'm big bit. I'm big bit. Why? Why? Why? Honestly, yes, chairs. All right, so with this clip, I was play fighting when I was punching you, and that's why you started laughing. No, you're... No, you're... Ah! You're fucking shit. Fuck you. Fuck you. Ah! Ah! Ah! You're fucking shit. What the hell was that? What the hell was that? Ah! So with this clip, when I threw the controller, I never actually hit you. However, the intent was still there, so I'm sorry for that. You need a piss off! Fuck you! We're playing FIFA. We're playing FIFA. You're still in your video, you removed the laughter. With this clip, yes, I did throw the bottle, but again, why did you cut out the laughter? Oh, fuck you! Fuck you! Now with this clip, you implied that I hit you with the bell, but if you watch the rest of the video, I never actually hit you. My trousers are falling. My trousers are falling. Give me my bell. Give me my bell. Give me my bell. Nico! Nico, right! All right, you're right. You're one now. You. You. I won that. Yes! You heard it here, ladies and gentlemen. I won that. And with the chair clip, I'm sorry. This was just wrong with me to do. Obviously, I didn't see it as a big thing. I just lost spending time with my brother. Clearly you do see it as a big thing. That's why you've made this point in the video. It's a shame because you never once told me that you are uncomfortable with any of the videos that we were making. Oh, okay! All right, that was so bad. Oh my god, I'm missing it. Yeah, because you're trying to put too much blood in your seat. Seconds? No. You even had videos on your channel attacking me like slavery fee for the rematch. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, okay! I mean, it's not like it was a one-way street. You got to whip me too. You even reacted to the slavery fee for years after and showed how much you enjoyed it. I was mad happy about this because I was the first one to score. I enjoyed you as much as you did. My fucking lord. No. Yes, yes, yes, yes, get your arms out! Get your arms out! Get it out! Get it out! No! Get it out! My mind's sicked out. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh my god! I'm like, oh my god. Oh my god. mult-brother that's so- You even asked me to be in your video to hit you in the true full die video. Hey guys! Come to show us gaming there. On my brother, my best friend, basically the doing this thing is called truth or die. My brother's gonna ask me questions if he thinks I'm lying, then he'll slap me. And if he thinks I'm telling the truth, then he just will slap me. So yeah. You even made a Q&A Sunday where you slapped me and called the video Q&A Sunday, slap KSI. All right, it's stage 8. I'm gonna slap JJ. So I'll see you this. What are you doing? What are you- You want to fight for this? Let's- Let's get it. It was all just playful fun. Siblings always fight. I don't understand why it's a problem now. Maybe I took it too far sometimes, but not once did you ever bring it up that I made you feel uncomfortable. Until now I guess. I mean, you've even made a video where you gloat on how you've made me cry in the past. Have you ever made your brother cry like a baby? Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I have. I punched his balls once and he cried. And then again, I would cry to that as well, so- But yeah, I just- I didn't think anything of it. As your my brother, like, I just didn't think it was that deep. Honestly, I would- Like, coming back from school, one of the main things I'd love to do is just play a scary game or anything with my brother. That was- honestly, that was amazing at the time. It was- I loved it. And it's still one of those memories I cherish today. But then too much became too much because, as you can see in some of the videos, you can see my discomfort. I often felt uncomfortable and I got tired of just being a laughing post, really. I got tired of it. Even back then, I would just simply walk out. I would just walk out because I- it wasn't funny. I didn't like it. What are you've given up? No, I'm leaving. You're leaving, yep? No, I'm gonna count to five. No, it's worth- it'll be more fun if we're out together. I'm always in this position. Look at that camera. No, wait- No, no, no, I want it. Imagine how you were tired of being a laughing stock, and that's why you left, but- in one of the clips you showed, all I wanted was for you to just sit closer next to me while we played a scary game. Look up far away. From the screen you are. You can see me. It was coming up, no, I won't- Oh, he's in this position. Why don't you take now? No, no, I'm- I want you closer. I don't want- No, no, no, no, that's how it is. I'm leaving, yeah. Why are you leaving? I'm not leaving. I'm not- What the hell? I'm not leaving. It's- it's- it's really gonna happen. I'm just getting- I don't want this. Yeah, I'm gonna count to five. No, it's- It's worth- it'll be more fun if we're out together. I'm always in this position. Look at that camera. No, wait- I'm leaving. No, no, I want- I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I guess the next part will come when he starts to my love. This is not really known, but my brother ended up kicking me out November time 2013. All right, so I kicked you out because you made our house disgusting. You never did any chores. You refused to listen to me when I repeatedly asked you to get rid of all the rubbish that you made from constantly ordering takeaways and never cleaning up after yourself. You never washed up after yourself. You never- I washed the dishes. You- you just never helped around the house. So I just got sick and tired of constantly having to clean up after you. And that's why I told mom and dad to pick you up after I kicked you out the house. In hindsight, maybe it was wrong with me to kick you out the house so suddenly, but if I was to be honest, after refusing to listen to me time and time again and you just not cleaning up your right, I'm sorry, but I just had to tell you to leave. And five years later, this is the same reason me, Josh, Vic and Simon also wanted to kick you out the side of the house. You're 22 years old, man. You need to learn to clean up after yourself. And it's not my responsibility or anyone else's other than your own to do that. I mean, it just wasn't fair on me or my housemates when we offered you a room rent-free in our house to help you with training. Deji, man, you were- you were constantly inviting random girls from Tinder and Bumble to our house. Our chef was making food while you were finding ways to not eat it or hide it or just throw it away. I don't get me wrong. Like, I tried to defend you. Eventually, everyone just got fed up of you just taking advantage of the whole situation. And Vic, Josh and Simon can all back me up on this. Even today, challenges with my brother, pain is a recurring theme. I mean, even our latest challenge we've done consists of pain. It punched me in the face! Do you want to get a stomach punch? No, you can get to call out what you want. No, no, no, you can't make that. You can't just make sure. I want to stomach punch. That's nothing! You've not got a punch in the stomach, are you? Oh my god. And you guys can see for yourself that pain is a very recurring theme with my brother when we do challenges. Challenge videos where pain is involved is not an exclusive thing to just you, Deji. On many occasions, on mine and other people's channels, we have both agreed to play a game with a forfeit. Like being a ledger, or being shot with a BB gun, or being shot with a paintball gun, jumping into nettles. So yeah, pain is a recurring theme. It's a recurring theme throughout the whole of my channel. And in videos I've been in with other YouTubers. I've never once forced you to do something you're not comfortable with, nor with any other YouTuber. That just forfeits is part of the game. Nothing exclusive to you, Deji. Or the idea of me wanting to inflict pain onto you. Even with the latest video we did together, you liked the idea and agreed to do it, especially since we both had trained for boxing matches. And quite frankly, the hits we were giving each other were nowhere near as brutal as the hits we got during training. I mean, we've even sparred together. Like, we punched each other in the face. So I don't understand how that video was my idea of wanting to inflict pain onto you. I mean, I've done this style of video with Vidal and Randolph. I mean, even you do challenges where you harm yourself and make yourself vomit for entertainment. And that's just the it, Deji. Everything we do, we do it all for entertainment. And that's it. I never forced you to do any of these videos. Either way, I'm sorry if you weren't comfortable with any of the videos that we've made. And I would have hoped that you could at least have told me at the time that you weren't comfortable. Also, we have done plenty of videos where there is no pain at all. They're trying not to laugh with my bro. The would you rather with my bro? And if you want to come back at me saying that none of those videos I mentioned are challenges then we did the whisper challenge. And there was no pain involved in that. Like to many 15, I was doing videos with this girl on everything. Long story short. JJ knowing that I talked to her, done videos with her and everything. It just came as a surprise when I found out that my brother had slept with her. And that really did affect me. Now, I can understand you being upset that I slept with this woman. But the way you make it out, like I had malicious intent towards you, that's just not true. So let me explain. I met her at a Jamie concert. She was outside. I said hi. We exchanged numbers. We talked for a bit. We met up at a hotel. We slept together. And that was it. I didn't even know she knew you. I don't even remember your name even being mentioned. For all I knew, she was just a girl that I met at a concert. I didn't even see her in any of your videos. I mean, Deji, I can't go to every girl that I meet and ask them if they know you. Deji, I'm sorry, but I generally didn't know. Anyway, I recently spoke to her about the whole situation in case I was missing anything. And well, here's what she had to say. Like, as you can see, she clearly didn't think that they were a thing. So yeah, I don't understand why you're trying to frame this as if I did this purposely to get at you. If I knew you guys were a thing or how you felt about her, then boy, I would not have done anything. When I lost to him, I was on the phone with Dunia. Some of you guys will know Dunia. I was on the phone with her and my brother came in the room and tried to embarrass me. I mean, I didn't realize we weren't allowed to make fun of each other anymore. I mean, you've embarrassed me several times, especially publicly. I mean, look. I mean, is it not normal for siblings to have banter between themselves? I've honestly never seen the jokes that we do as a big deal. For my point, it's just friendly banter between brothers. I mean, I would have loved for you to have told me personally how you felt about these videos or the banter between us. I mean, if I knew it was a serious issue for you, I would have stopped. But, you know, I had to find out via video on your channel. Obviously, now you're in a place where these jokes are no longer funny to you. So, I won't publicly mention your name anymore to avoid things like this happening in the future. Name a dead YouTube channel. Degy. I didn't appreciate it considering I'm not friends with the guy, really. I spent time in America with him, but I didn't see him as a friend, but he was close to my brother, so I considered him somewhat family. But I responded like this. You are literally... You are the side-men as well as JJ's bitch. You are literally their bitch. You're JJ's cameraman. He pays your salary. I mean, you spend more time with JJ than you do your own wife. So, I do admit my response was definitely out of line. I should not have mentioned his wife, but then his response was just completely unnecessary. Completely unnecessary. He responded back with a diss track. In his diss track, he pretty much mentions everything regarding our trip to LA. He made things that were private public. We had a group chat, and he pretty much just made everything in that group chat public. You're right, I've been living in the side-men house. I took your room bitch to kick your wife cause you were paying rent. You couldn't find a cash limit, glad it and take out the track. What really upset me, what really, really hurt me during that whole thing was not the diss track. It was how my brother reacted to his diss track. Instead of my brother keeping neutral or even sticking up for me, instead he decided, instead he was sticking up for his friend, claiming that everything he said in his diss track was true. Just supporting him. Take a joke, you need to relax, she's back in LA. I was paying for your taxis. You're the poorest rich man. Hey, that's true. But you're wishing you're famous. Now, did he tell me, are you brain-knit? Cause you still live with your parents. I got low-r TTP. Too busy to take animals to the best state. Oh, no! No! No! He's spitting a lot of facts. It's all right. It's all right. Oh man, I was being neutral, did you? I even said it in the beginning of the video. Oh man, talking to an officer in Germany, it is all kicking off. I'm in a way of position. My bro, best is one of my best mates. Please, you gotta remember, I'm in a weird situation. I'm in the middle of all of this. It's not easy, it's not easy. Also, why are you giving a noy to me for saying true at what Randall said when you've done the exact same thing? But how you making gone thing is with a straight face you have to wear a suit to school. You fucking disgrace. He did. He did. Keep that head in, you so scared. Why? Won't you hide him, Lord? Is it your girlfriend or your hair? Ah-ha! He is hiding his girlfriend. All right, Lion. He's spitting facts. DJ is hiding his girlfriend. I not once, I've ever said anything about it until now. Also, when it came to your district, I begged you up. Fat fuck, side men's house, but you old gas stuff. You told him to track and you want to act tough. Oh, I told him to ring you. Oh! This, this, this, this back. It's about to be so big, you fuck fuck. I'm gonna go deep, I'm just saying just send to the dials for your balls, I'll keep to the balls. All right, when did you get good at rapping? Yeah! Why did this happen? I guess he's had a whole year to work on his craft. This, yeah, this is actually bangs. But you never included that. Just saying everything, every allegation in his district was true. And I just, I took that as a low blow. Instead of supporting me, he decided to support his friend. Every allegation in Randolph's first district is true. Okay, I'm not going to lie to the audience. That's, I'm sorry, that's just not me. Also, it's not fair to discredit Randolph by lying and saying it's not true just for your benefit. Listen, Dej, literally in your video, this is what you said. In his district, he pretty much mentions everything regarding our trip to LA. He made things that were private public. We had a group chat and he pretty much just made everything in that group chat public. Like you even said it yourself, these aren't allegations if there's proof. These are just hard facts. Randolph is one of my oldest and closest friends and he has done so much for me. I'm sorry, that's what I'm not going to just turn on him for making a diss track on you just because we're related. You're not my only loyalty. I was in a tough position and that is why I wanted to remain neutral. Honestly, I felt betrayed. I was thought my brother would have my back in dark times, but as I look at the previous years, it looks like my brother doesn't really support me. Like the love we both have is not reciprocal. This is one of the reasons why I dropped the diss track on my brother. Say I don't support you, but I have publicly and privately. I even made a public video back in December where I mentioned all the times that I had supported you. You said I've never supported you, but Dej, come on man. You know that's not true. You know that's not true. When you were training for the fight, I was there to help you. Remember how important I said cardio was? Remember when I took those photos of you of what you'd look like before and after? Remember when I was telling you how to spar with Gibb, telling you how to pace yourself when you were in the ring? I was also telling you how to work on your defense and like different ways to defend the jab and defend across, etc. And remember the amount of times we just spared together, Dej. The amount of times. Even when you were playing Fortnite, I was there in your room just saying, let's train, let's train, let's get ready for this fight. Like I was there supporting you. And even before that, remember the amount of videos we've done together to help your channel grow like, Dej, come on. You cannot say I have not supported you. Even on videos, when it came to diss tracks, I supported you. I'm on my side and my driveway, 14 year old bitch when I come at me sideways. You should be in school to your homework. I'm giving shit about you or your best friends. Just if you've a tea girl to your breast her, I'm a tissue casually in my best shirt. Oh, what? To the stage. Reload, reload, yo. Come with me with that cold, that cold fire. Yo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yo, I did not expect that cold so wrong. So in my response to JJ's friend, his diss track on me, in my diss track, I set a controversial bar of that JJ paid for his wedding. Not an attack on JJ, it was an attack on JJ's friend. The one thing you ain't been spreading is that JJ paid for your wedding. My brother angry of me showing screenshots that he paid for his friend's wedding. And I admit, that was out of line. I should not have done that. It was more out of anger. I'm glad that you admit this is wrong. You mean out of anger, it was out of line, but that you're still lying. You're saying that I pay for Randall's wedding, but you know, and I know that isn't true. It was a wedding gift, and I was it. To be honest, I can't blame you for this. I was my mom's error for showing you my bank details for a diss track. Right now you're looking at my mom's phone and these are the messages that she's sending to my bro. So I managed to unlock my mom's phone by using the face recognition feature. And then I ran into a room and locked the door and then proceeded to film the conversation. But what really cemented me doing a diss track on my brother, which what really just betrayed me was my brother's friends in his second diss track on me. But not what was sent in the diss track. It's the fact that my brother heard the diss track before it went out and he didn't try and stop it. Which gave me more of a desire to do a diss track on my brother. I would take a bullet for your brother but if the trick is same in that true, I'm a bully. As well as in his second diss track on me, he shows a private video that was between me and my brother in his diss track of us sparring, which was just between myself and my bro. And that was in his diss track. And cry sparring it the crib all we did. Which further shows that my brother played a part to his second diss track. Why would I stop a diss track that has nothing to do with me? Why is it my place to tell Randolph what he can and can't upload? Like I said, I was trying to be neutral in this whole situation and not get involved. It was awkward for me because it was between one of my best friends and my brother. But you're the one that dragged me into all of this by making a diss track on me. Plus, the clip that I gave to Randolph isn't at all damaging to you. Randolph asked me if I had any sparring footage for his music video and I did. So I gave it to him. That's it. I mean, I'll admit, it does look like I was helping him with his diss track, but I can promise you that genuinely wasn't the case. If I'm being honest with the sparring footage, you don't even look bad. If anything, it's sure that we were at least training for the fight and that I was helping you with training. Plus, the sparring clip was so minimal in the video that I'm struggling to find why you're so upset about it. Now, what was said in his second diss track was criminal. It ruined my credibility and it defamated my character. Alligations of me getting a gold pregnant and then leaving her and other things of underage girls and stuff like that. The allegations in the diss track were far from the truth. They weren't true at all. And the knowing fact that he heard the diss track before it went out further just put me in a dark place. How can you disprove an allegation simply by saying it's not true when there is evidence? I'll explain more about this point near the end of the video. What was going through my head? I couldn't explain. Because I have done nothing but support my brother in everything. Like this isn't true. You've ridiculed me several times over the years. Especially during the time I got banned at Eurogamer. I mean, that's not supportive at all. Even tweets like this are ridiculous. Brothers meant to stick by no matter what. Have your back no matter what. No matter what. So you going on Logan Paul's podcast when I asked you not to is you having my back no matter what. Making a diss track on me is you having my back no matter what. I mean, you literally reacted to Cuideca's diss track and said this. You know what's funny? I like it when we call it insecure. It's like you kind of know, say, you know. JJ, I'm so sorry, you're angry. Hair lines are fucked up, your barber is taking. I'm 18. Wait, well, I don't get it. Take key. Oh, because my man has a big forehead. Oh, OK. Keep that hidden, you're so scared. Why won't you hide him, or is it your girlfriend, or your hair? Oh, what's wrong? He is hiding his girlfriend. All right, line. He is, he's spitting facts. JJ is hiding his girlfriend. I am actually impressed. I was not expecting flames. I mean, you could teach JJ one or two things. And this has come from his brother. Like, fam, seriously, how are you going to have a go at me, not being neutral, and then you go and do this? I mean, clearly, you don't practice what you preach, saying that family should always have your back no matter what. Now, in my district, on my bro, everything is known fact. Everything I say in the district is known fact. I don't spill any secrets, nothing. Everything is known fact. Well, I've disproved the majority of what you said. So now what? You can't say everything in the district was known fact when there are things that are just not true. For example, I'm a track of my own, but you fuck to go with a caravan. This is the lie. I've never fought to go in a caravan. Why are you making false samma about me? Where is your evidence? Take my parents to the side and get rid of me. This was also a lie. I didn't want to get rid of you. I wanted to talk to mom and dad without you there because I know how much you can manipulate them when you're there. I mean, surely I'm allowed to talk to my parents privately without you having to be there. Also, this wasn't a known fact at all. How would anyone else other than me and you know this? You're the one that made it known. Friends who live there for the dough. Okay. Oh no. Your friends who live there, so they blow. How is this a known fact? This is literally your opinion. You even fed lies to your friends in your district. They don't dig for text in those doors, but you're on your full for bullshit. This isn't known or a fact. I never baited Deji out for texting those girls at any point in time. Not once did I mention those texts. It was entirely in Randall's district. And the fact that he said that I'm on my full for portion is not only untrue, it is extremely disrespectful. And you can't deny that you didn't tell Jalow because you said on Logan Paul's podcast. I'm on about abortions. Yeah. Yeah, I'm on about abortions. Yeah. What about abortions? So, um, well, like I said, I heard that he's had abortions. He's like, well, you're born right there, said four. Well, for the later lyric in the song, he said he has fourth abortion. He's had like pregnancy scares. Scars are big. Like how weak is not a lot of scared? Not pregnancy scares. Like he actually had to go pregnant to the point that they, you know, they have to go to a clinic. Four times. Well, I don't know if it's more, but, like, it's probably more. It's more. Is that true, dog? Because that line's kind of a, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's heavy. Yeah, I hate to see that. None of this would be out in the public without you exposing it in the district. So you really can't say that your district is based on known facts. With my district, my brother gave me permission to upload it. Permission was given. He said you cannot upload the district. Upon me uploading my district and my brother, Logan Paul invited me to his podcast. So what made you comfortable coming unimposive today? Because my beef isn't really with you. And I guess I did have beef with Jake, but it was mainly just to sell the fight. That was the main reason. So like, it's not. I know he said when on the Shane Dorsen thing that he wanted to kill me and stuff. I, I, I, he did. Yeah, he said he wanted to kill me. Yeah. And the reason I accepted it is because I just felt betrayed. I felt hurt. And in all honesty, I was just tired of doing anything my brother wanted me to do. OK, so this is the issue with you. You're not consistent with how you act towards me. I was so reluctant in saying that it was OK for you to put up the district. But I let it slide because I knew it would help your channel. But going on Logan Paul's podcast, I told you I didn't want you to go on it. And you can't say that I'm lying because here's the text between us. How do you think it made me feel to see my own brother openly discuss our issues with the one guy I hate? That is completely different to a district which I knew would help your channel. But getting Logan involved and going on his podcast had no other purpose than to betray me. Not once have I done something like that to you. I mean, how is that justified by me staying neutral when you had beef with Randolph? I'm sorry, Deji, but you can't just pick and choose when you want to listen to my opinion on a situation that suits you and then expect me to be OK with it. So I went on Logan Paul's podcast. I saw it as a way to just branch out from my bro. I honestly did. So you thought going on Logan Paul's podcast to talk about me was the best way to branch out from my bro. If you went on there to talk about something else, then fine. But you did it. It was all pretty much about me. The best way, Deji, to branch out from me is to not talk about me at all. And then on top of that, make good quality content that your fans would enjoy. Does he have a guard complex? Is it me, God? That's what I mean. His ego is insane. He's like here is district to Kudecker. He compared himself to Eris. When he did the thing with you, he'd say, I'm a God. Like, I don't actually think he thinks he's a God. Yeah, what's going on? What's going on with him not getting back to? So I don't know. I don't know. That's like not me at all about I have no clue. Is he just eating mashed potatoes and banging strippers and shit like what's he doing? Well, I know he's doing something with strippers, especially on the snapshot. Does anything to do with the bandana? The bandana. I mean, something. So no, so that bandana, it's just a big forehead behind it. That's it. Like, he's a receding head. Why doesn't he get a little less forehead? He's got money. Well, none of these points were about the diss track. These were all unrelated digs towards me. So yet again, you're not being accurate with your claims. Considering I've held out my brother with his channel a lot, like a series that my brother currently does, called One Question Go. When I saw my brother, I showed him a video where a guy got his fans to just ask him questions on Discord and I told him that he should do something similar to that. And no credit was given to me. When he did the video, he didn't give me any credit at all. Well, did you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't give you credit for advising me on doing a video that we both saw. But wouldn't you agree that me doing a One Question Go video on your channel did way more for you than if I had just given you a 10 second shout on one of my One Question Go videos. Financially and viewership wise. Plus, I've given you advice on several videos like the I nearly got shot video or us doing duos on Fortnite. And I got no credit for that. But the difference is, I don't care. I don't feel the need to have credit when I'm just helping out my brother. So the situation of me kicking my brother out on Christmas has been taken out of context incredibly. So my brother and I, when I was in LA, we agreed to talk, but my brother, he didn't come to talk, he came to fight. Instead of coming to talk, he threatened to smash my computer and he was acting irate. He was just acting so erratic. It wasn't. I couldn't explain it. Upon threatening to smash my computer, I locked myself in my office just so he couldn't do so. And little did I know, this whole situation, my brother was recording the whole situation. Which further shows my brother's manipulation, considering he asked to talk. We agreed to talk and he came for a fight. As I locked myself in my office, he did he threatened to smash the door, saying he'll smash the door down. Obviously my parents stopped him. For the safety of my parents and due to his behavior, I asked him if he could just, if he could leave my house or I'll call the police, which he recorded and took out of context completely. So he tweeted this out, the voice message of me saying, leave my house or I'll call the police. He tweeted that out, causing fans to just turn on me. They turned on me. Not knowing the situation or why I told him, why I told him to leave my house. The fans turned on me, further showing how we just manipulated the situation. Hello, I'm moving in. I can't, can you hear me? You can't hear me? I'm here. Give away, leave my house. Shut the fuck off. I can't. You can't understand me. You can't understand me. Yes, for the small house. Thank you. I don't want him here. What the hell? How police is that? I'm going to... Sorry, no. No problem. No, no, no. I'm going to do it on Emma. Sorry, no problem. No, no. I'm leaving. I'm off. Please get me that. Let him off. Let him go. Bye. Bye. Initially, when I went to see the family on Christmas day, I came to talk. I came to reason. I came to fix the situation. I came to understand why my brother was so angry at me to the point of him making a diss track on me. And then when I went, my brother, my mom, and my dad, pretty much said it was all my fault. I'll come to him and be like, believe those videos. Those videos don't really be off. Believe that diss track. That diss track doesn't even be off. You don't need to have a diss track. Oh, dissing me. Yeah, I don't think you get that. You need to take down all the videos and all the assignments. What they'd be saying about your brother. And I include the quidudzi. That's got nothing to do with me. You don't got everything. Why? Why? No, no, no. You don't go everything. Why? Because explain why. You're part of the assignment. Why? You're part of it. And so, no, no, no. So, who's in control of random? I'm not. Who's in control? You. What? You think. What do you think? No, that's a sign. No, that's a sign. And that is why I tweeted that it's always my fault. That's how I was made to feel by my family. It was not me trying to manipulate the situation at all. I also wanted my brother to remove the diss track because I felt like in order for us to essentially move on, the video had to go and he refused. So, I got upset and I said I would smash his computer. And yes, I shouldn't have threatened him but I was just so annoyed. And then that's when he locked himself in his room where the computer was. And then I said I would smash the door down if he doesn't come out to talk. Again, I was completely out of line but I'm sorry, I was just, I was just so frustrated, man. I just wanted to talk as a family to resolve the issue privately. So I then eventually told me to leave and I did. I came to the house to reason but he just wasn't prepared to do so. And that's why I tweeted and posted the audio clip. Also, my brother said I was manipulating the situation by recording our conversations during Christmas Day. But he did exactly the same thing. Further things happen when I asked my brother to leave my house but I'm not going to mention that. I'm not going to mention that in this video. I have no idea what he's talking about here. Nothing else happened when I left. As you heard in the recording that he used in this video, I just accepted the situation was at last cause and left. I drove back to my house on Christmas Day and that was it. He started playing victim on social media saying I kicked him out on Christmas for no reason. Whereas there was a huge reason. He was at, he was, he didn't come here to talk. Right, like brother to brother, he came here to fight me. Degy, I, I never said you kicked me out for no reason. We both got to know each other that day. You didn't want to talk it through or listen to my perspective. You were persistent in blaming me for Randolph dissing you and you said the whole situation was essentially my fault. Honestly, the beef between you and Randolph had nothing to do with me. You just dragged me into it. I mean, he said he wanted to talk. Yeah, he was recording the whole situation. Which is just, like I said, it shows manipulation. So I too was recording the situation. I only started recording when I locked myself in my room in my office. Because he wasn't acting like he wanted to talk. He was acting like he wanted to fight me. I wasn't trying to fight you at all. I never laid a finger on you. This caused us to have a back and forth on Twitter. But of course, as he has more followers, as he was playing victim, people were just ignoring me. They were just saying that I was lying. But anything I said just didn't matter. The amount of followers or fans someone has doesn't determine whether they're right or wrong. You recorded the whole conversation as well. You could have shown how out of context my voice member was, but you didn't. This caused me to get hate to all social medias. I started to lose subscribers, fans, and I even started to get thoughts of maybe life was better off without me. If I was honest, I was just saying, what was the point? I never ever ever ever ever ever want you to have thoughts like that. I never want you to feel like that at all. And it pains me that you felt like that because of a disagreement between us. You should always know you can talk to me, especially if you're having dark thoughts or just feeling low. I'm always here for you whether we're on good terms or bad terms. Whenever you message me, I always reply, I want you to succeed in everything you do. But, Deji, you have to communicate with me how else am I going to know how you're feeling? And this isn't just directed at Deji. If any of you watching this have thoughts like this, then you should 100% know that someone fucking cares for you, man. And loves you. You should never feel alone. And yeah, that's why I'm giving all the money. I've made on this video to suicide prevention charities because suicide should never be. If I'm honest, I've always been alone in this YouTube scene. I've always been alone wolf. I've only been really done videos with, or in my family, my brother and my parents. That's just not true, Deji. You've done videos with many other YouTubers. The Racka Racka twins, Dax, Crypt, Jalow and many, many, many women. There are loads of YouTubers who would love to do videos with you. You're 100% definitely not alone in this YouTube scene, Deji. This further calls me to get hate. And I asked my brother if he could stop trash talking me in videos. Where his only response was for me to delete the disc track. But then going back to my brother's texts at the end of the day, it's just a disc track. It isn't just a disc track though. It's a disc track at your own brother. This is just completely different, man. You're publicly backstabbing your own brother. This isn't just a YouTube feud anymore. It's a family one now. My brother laughed at the situation and reacted to the disc track, reacted to my video to on him and was just making fun of the situation. Those stupid and you fucking hell. You idiot. You're honestly a human. You're a human. You're my car's strategy. I can't stand this. So the little respect I had, I took it and I prohibited the disc track. Well, Deji, I'm sorry. Okay, this was extremely insensitive. But like I said in the beginning of this video, me laughing at the situation helped me get through it. Last December, hands down, man. The worst month of my life, man. If you ask anyone around me how I was feeling during December, they would all tell you that I was miserable. I hated that month and I never, ever want to relive it again. You weren't the only one that was affected. The disc track had been made private. And I then told my brother to stop trash talking me in videos, which he did not stop. He carried on trash talking me in videos. Even after I put the disc track down. Deji, there is no evidence of you telling me to stop trash talking you. Please show me you telling me to stop trash talking you after you prioured the music video. Quite frankly, it never happened. Besides, I never even trash talked to you. I literally was just laughing at memes. I was literally laughing at memes that were created by you coming at me for no reason. Like I said, I'd rather laugh than cry. And it's not like I was even encouraging it. I literally told my audience to stop making them. So a recurring thing that I found out about my brother is that he tends to attack people when they're down. So, for instance, Joe Weller, after being him in the whole fight, he still continued to bash him for no reason. Round number one. Alright, let's see how much Weller has improved. Holy crap, he actually punched all my hardies and proved. Wow! Deji, you attacked Joe Weller as well. Literally three months after I fought him. I don't know if you guys would ask me what happens to Joe Weller. My man's at a part. I mean, look at him. He's been smacked. He's like, oh, the brain's awesome. Just let his head. You know what I'll fix your money, alright? Then one way is like this. Have you seen it? Another example is net nobody. When he was going through a whole custody battle for his son against his baby mama, well, he was having beef with JJ. JJ decided, oh, let me get his baby mama in my disc track, which obviously I doubt he would be okay with. There's no way in hell we'd be okay with it. So, I've noticed that my brother tends to attack people when they're at the lowest points. If you thought it was so terrible, why did you act like this when you were reacting to my disc track on him? Imagine the killing you in the tapiole. Let nobody's gone. Just saying, let nobody, it's finished. Out with this. Out with this. Oh, my goodness. Wow. Fuck, it's net nobody going to come up with. Oh, singing and shit. You suck. I've noticed that my brother tends to attack people when they're at the lowest points, which is just something I wanted to put out there. And to those two, I want to say I'm sorry for playing party to it. Then you've done the exact same thing though. You can't just change your tune to fit your argument and make me look like the bad guy. Also, how is this you defending yourself? You literally just said, I'm just putting this out there. You're attacking me now. My brother also uses subliminal messaging against me. For example, he'll say that he wants his second channel to take over my main channel. To which his fans will try and accomplish, considering he's not the only one who's been there. He's much bigger than me. Much bigger than me. Like, he sees everything as a competition between us. Whereas I don't. I don't have competition with family. But it seems like he does. I admit, I am a competitive person. That is why I am in the position I'm in today. To put it quite simply, I do not like to lose. But I don't see how you can get anywhere without being at least a little bit competitive. So yeah, I don't understand why this is a bad thing to have. This is what makes me want to be successful. And even within family, sibling rivalry is totally a normal thing. We're in a competitive industry. We have to do what we can to stay on top. YouTube is a huge platform. Yeah, he wants to overtake my channel. Which will result in me losing subscribers for his gain. Listen, this is going to be a revelation for you. Why do you care so much if I overtake you in subs? Do you know why you care so much? It's because you're competitive. I mean, realistically, it's not even that deep. I've lost millions of subscribers in my time. And I'm losing subscribers right now. But you still don't see me complaining. In my whole YouTube career, I have lost 7.6 million subscribers, did you? Come on, man. It ain't that deep. So he would say something and then end it with I'm joking. Whereas he's not joking. He's serious about the message. Whereas people will obviously take this as him being serious. It's just that I'm joking as this is the fence mechanism. No, it would really top it off. If my second channel was able to overtake Deji, subscribe. That would really piss a lot. Deji, I'm kidding. It's a joke. It's a joke. Deji, this is all a joke. Please do not make a video about me. Please do not go in on me. Please don't claim you're the victim. Deji, this is just banter. This is just friendly competition. That is all, okay? Just some fun brother rivalry. Another piece of subliminal messaging my brother does is he shows him unsubscribing from my channel in a video. And to the result in his fans also unsubscribing from my channel. Wait a minute, my other channel's low. Let me just fix that real quick. There we go. Alright. So from all of this, it's clear that you do care about subscribers. Otherwise you wouldn't bring it up. God knows why, because you literally don't get paid from subscribers. Pretty much just a number these days. People unsubscribed from you because I did. Then clearly they weren't fans in the first place. Or maybe they are fans and they're just trolling. But, Deji, who cares? End of the day, it's your content that makes people interested in you. If you put up bad content, eventually people aren't going to care about it anymore. Describors don't affect your livelihood, Deji. It affects your ego. And that's just it. You also told those fans to tweet me to delete my channel. But on Twitter, not on my YouTube channel, because that would give me views. Don't do a twist channel, because I'll get them views. I'd say just tweet him. Tweet him saying delete your channel. But obviously his fans still wrote this on my channel as well. He is basically using his fans to attack me, also known as mob mentality. Another piece of subliminal messaging that my brother uses is him saying that I'm just trying to reach 10 million subs. That I betrayed him just to try and reach 10 million subs. Which is far from the truth, considering if anybody knows me, they know I don't focus on numbers. I didn't even know how to look at analytics. You're massively contradicting yourself. As I've just said, it's clear that you do care about the numbers. Why would you even make a video faking getting a diamond play button if you don't care about the numbers? You even said this in the video. I've been stuck on 9.7 million subscribers for the longest time on this channel. I've been on 9.7 million subscribers for 6 months. I've never even done a 2 million, 3 million, 4 or 5 going so on special. I've never done a milestone video special. The only one I've ever done is 1 million. 1 million subscribers. What even is this sentence? That's like saying you've never, ever punched anyone in the face. Besides that one time, you punched someone in the face. Ultimately, you're still punched someone in the face. So you can't say you've never made a subscriber milestone video because you have. Anyway, it's clear that you do care about numbers. Even pointless numbers like subscribers. There's no point claiming you don't when everything you're saying shows that you do care. So just say that you care. Just be honest. I mean, how can I blame me for caring about numbers when I used to do the exact same thing? I used to be obsessed with how many subscribers I had. How many followers I had on Instagram. How many views I got on my videos, etc. I was always focused on finding ways to increase my numbers. To the point where I was doing videos that I just wasn't passionate about. But I did it because I knew it would get me the views. I wasn't making videos for me anymore. And that's why I left in 2017. Yeah, I just wasn't happy at all. So after my break, I made sure I never focused on numbers ever again. And instead did everything for me. If I'm passionate about something, then people will see that and enjoy the content with me. I mean, there's enough people in the world. Someone's going to enjoy something you enjoy doing. But yeah, I know. We live in a society where everyone just focuses on numbers these days, man. So sometimes it's good to just step back and just not worry about that. He unfollowed me on all social media platforms. But I never unfollowed him. So what he did, he blocked me on Instagram and then unblocked me. Just to make it look like I unfollowed him when he unfollowed me, when I followed him back. If you understand what I mean. I mean, sometimes people got an notification that I followed him, which also shows signs of manipulation. I got annoyed when you uploaded the disc track. That's why I am pulsally unfollowed you. It's got nothing to do with manipulation. I've always been scared to stand up to my brother. Considering he has more social power, social media power than me. Like he has more social media friends than I do. So I've always just been very scared to stand up for Governors. Well, you weren't afraid to stand up for yourself when you made a whole disc track on me. He even told me in front of our parents to stop talking to his YouTube friends. Which is one reason why you don't really see me doing collaborations with other YouTubers. Like I said earlier in a video, you have done videos with other YouTubers. And Dej, I never told you to stop talking to my friends. Why would I say that? You can make videos with any of my friends. Why would I stop you? How can I stop you? If a YouTuber wants to do a video with you, then they're going to do a video with you. Also, Dej, you've got to remember that it's not just the one-way street. You can't just expect people to ask you to do collabs. You sometimes have to reach out for yourself. He even undermines me in videos for a comical effect. Like we did a video together that I just couldn't upload because I just felt so belittled. I'm putting so much on it. I'm putting so much on it. You all put on it. I'm going to get a fucking door. So dumb. You're dumb. You're looking down at this. Yeah. I'm playing a game. Why are you so busy? You play that. What does that mean? You play. I'm not pussy. You play. You play. You play. You piss me off. No, no. You treat me like shit. You play. I'm not treating you like shit. Don't call me down. I told you to go down. Don't call me down. You will not waste a door. Yeah. Don't call me down. You're not dumb. You're not dumb. Just play the game. This is just too rough as fine. I'm not bringing you down. I was just annoyed that you didn't want to play the scary game. Also, you literally called me dumb as well. And I even apologize at the end so we could just continue with the video. We're not going to just agree on everything we do. We're going to clash and how arguments. So why does that make me a bad person? I cannot upload it because I personally, I just, I didn't like it. I didn't like the way he was talking to me. I didn't like the way he treated me or anything. I just, I just, I just couldn't upload it. I just, I just don't like being belittled. I mean, you're doing the exact same thing to me in this video. And you don't see me complaining. Shit! What the fuck? I didn't know that was the guy there! Oh, fah! Oh my goodness. I swear I looked. I swear I looked. I looked. He sucked. You're so bad! I swear I looked. I swear I looked at him. Let's do it! Let's do it! I looked everywhere. There was no one there! You're so bad! And even some of my fans have realized that my brother doesn't, he doesn't, it doesn't look like he wants to do videos of me. Just from his body language. It makes it look like he just feels forced to be in videos of me. Bitch, you're not the only one I do this for. I do this on other people's channels as well. You seeing anything that seems familiar? Um. Any... Abuts... And long way... Anything? What? I guess it could be down here. I have no idea. Also, some of the intro is video where we're buying this food. It's kinda weird that you're not here now. That's what I'm saying. But yeah, we're trying to make this snack, be it in America. Are you guys swimming your bag there? That's just how I am, dude. Sometimes I'm just not in the mood. Sometimes I'm just tired. Sometimes I just can't be bothered. You know, I'm not fake. I'm not gonna pretend that I have energy 100% of the time. Or I'm not gonna pretend I'm excited all the time about everything that I do. I'm just gonna be me if I'm just dead slouch like this. Like, I'm still doing the video. I mean, I don't know how this is the point really. Because yeah, that's just me, man. My brother is acting like he has not done anything. Anything wrong in this whole situation. When he goes on podcast or anything, he just acts like he's the victim in the whole situation. He just acts like I did everything. Everything is my fault. And that really pains me. Because that makes the fans think that I'm the bad guy. I'm the one who started all this. Yeah, no, I'm just done with him now. Is it, is it literally like? Yeah, yeah. I don't care. I won't follow them. I, you know, I don't care anymore. But... He's, he's the latest bad guy you can rest in. And this just makes me believe that he's just so far gone in his own ego for him to not realize what he's doing. Ledge, I'm not saying I'm a victim. I'm just saying the truth. I'm not trying to manipulate the situation. I just want this to be over and done with. I want my point of view to be expressed as much as you want yours. I mean, I've been trying to keep this as private as possible. And that's why I haven't really said much on the whole matter. But now it's clear to me from your video that you are upset with the whole situation. And that's why I want to make things right. That's why I'm making this video. I admit I need to work on being closer with mom and dad. And that's why recently I've come to the house more often. I also hit you up for us to do videos together because I was trying to help improve things on your channel. I've also tried to communicate with you more as well. So, you know, I'm actively trying to make things better. But obviously you just want me to say this publicly. So, that is why I'm doing this video. And that's why I'm responding to you. My brother thinks he knows me. But he really doesn't know anything about me. He doesn't even know much about my parents. I have never said I know you. In fact, I definitely do not know you. Nor do you know me. And that's why we need to work on this relationship as a family. He doesn't even know my parents' birthdays. My dad had to remind my brother when my mom's birthday was. My dad had to literally remind him on the day that it's, you know, our mom's birthday. It's just sad. Honestly, it's sad. I'm sorry, Deji, but people forget. I was really busy at the time. I was in Dubai. I was supporting Vidal with his fight. And it's not like I left it for like a week. I literally woke up in the middle of the night and messaged my mom instantly. Yes, I forgot, but it doesn't mean that I don't care. I sent her a message as soon as my dad reminded me. Our mom's birthday is May the 4th. Our dad's birthday is August 28th. And your birthday is December the 9th. People forget, Deji. I'm sorry. I said I'd be birthday to you last year. And you never replied. Either way, how is this you defending yourself? Our parents' birthday have nothing to do with us not knowing each other. At this point, you're literally just attacking me. You're trying to make me look as bad as possible. You're trying to make it look like I don't care about the family. I thought the intention of your video was to defend yourself. Not attack me. I was bringing up that I was late to wish my mom a happy birthday defending yourself. How is it anything to do with you at all? My brother even called my dad saying that he was going to destroy my channel. And then after that call, these are the texts that preceded after him saying that if my dad recorded the call that he would copyright strike the video. And it's very sad that my brother assumes that my dad would do something disgusting like that. If I have said that, it would have been in the heat of the moment. I know I am positively say things that I don't mean when I get angry or upset. It's something I'm definitely working on, I do not want your channel to be destroyed. I want us both to succeed. People will take this the wrong way and see this as an attack. But this is literally just me sticking up for myself. For years, I've been suppressed. But me making this video, I don't want any negativity towards my brother. From what you've heard in this video, please. I did not make this video for my brother to get hate or any negativity. I simply made this video because I had to stick up for myself. I'm tired of people seeing me as the bad guy when they don't know the full situation. It's you knew perfectly well that you making this video would get me hate. Otherwise, you would have approached me privately. In the description, you even said that you don't want to be seen as the bad guy anymore. So, do you want me to be seen as the bad guy now? There's no bad guys or good guys in this whole situation. We both made mistakes. And I know, even though I don't want it, that you might get a bit of hate from this video. Unfortunately, this is a byproduct of us doing this publicly. It's something that we just have to live with and accept. Anyway, I'll say this again. I think it's best for us to do this privately, man. Alright, and that's the first video done. So, in preparing for this video, my brother uploaded... It's another video in anticipation of my reply. I can only see this as an attempt to damage control. But yeah, I guess I'll have to go through this second video as well now. And defend myself yet again. So, let's do this. Looking at his tweets after I uploaded my video, further shows his immaturity towards the situation. Here are some of his tweets. It's actually sickening when I look at it because this is a serious situation and he's treating it like a joke. To this, all of these tweets were made before I even watched your video. I know it was wrong of me to judge the video before even watching it, but I saw the description and I saw the thumbnail and the title and I was like, oh, here we go again. It's another video of him going at me. And that's why I tweeted the meme and showed my audience that I did not want to go through why I went through again in December. And then once I watched the video, I knew I had to respond and take this seriously. So, I'm sorry for not initially, initially, initially, oh my god, initially, I'm sorry for not initially taking this seriously. He even sent me a text saying, congratulations, completely missing the whole point of my video. Well, Dij, I'm not gonna lie. This is truly how I feel. The timing of your video just doesn't look good on your part and you have to admit this. So, you just happen to feel like this a week after the whole James Charles Show. It also started with a 40 minute exposing video that blew up massively. You just happen to bring this all out at a time when you were losing subscribers and your views were down. And don't even try and say that you don't care about subscribers or numbers because we've already established that you clearly do. I mean, did you can't deny the similarities and the timings? Everyone knows how badly you want to hit 10 million subscribers. To the point of view, even freaking getting the 10 million subscriber plat. Yeah, if this is how you want to do it, then I guess fine. What really upset me is not that my brother is gonna be responding. It's that my brother is trying to dig up dirt in his response towards me. He tweeted out, you know, if anybody has any stories with me to DM him. And if it's just, it's sad that he's now going that path. He's going the path of destruction. Alright, so let me explain this to you. Yes, I was annoyed. Yes, initially I wanted to highlight some of the allegations that I have heard against you regarding women. I wanted to bring them to your attention to make you realize that what you've been doing is wrong. I'm sorry about it, it was just frustrating that in your video you were claiming that you had done nothing wrong. And that all of the allegations were just false. But with so many women coming forward with similar stories, these allegations don't look so false to me, to be honest. And to be honest, your second video just adds to the credibility of these women. Why would you make a video to defend yourself when you don't even know what I'm going to say? Why would you go so far as to threaten me with legal action when you don't even know what the allegations are? If you didn't think that there was some truth in them, then you wouldn't have anything to worry about. But because they're just allegations, I'm not going to publicly address it. Instead, I'm going to privately send you the stories that these women have come forward with. And I hope that you do the right thing in first acknowledging that you have in the past made several women feel uncomfortable, as well as feel manipulated. And then secondly, apologizing to these women and any other women for that matter. The whole video was literally not an attack. I did not lie at all in the whole video. Well, we all know now how untrue this is. I even have a conversation, a DM conversation that my brother had with a fan who was obviously conversed with me in the past. I just look for yourself. This isn't about me trying to destroy you. This is about you learning to take responsibility over your actions. You need to own up to your mistakes and apologize. And not just the ones you've been called up on. I mean, your video was supposedly about making me realize what I've done wrong. Well, I'm going to make you realize what you've done wrong. So I have the screenshots of you talking to her on Facebook. The only reason I messaged her was to make sure that the screenshots were real. I know that they are. Either way, I'm not going to share anything publicly because that's just not fair on her. But yeah, you just need to own up and apologize, did you? Her words herself. And I don't want your brother to know I messaged you either because he doesn't seem like a very nice person. Like, when I told him no, he was so desperate and somewhat manipulative trying to get me to send screenshots. And that's her words herself. I did not co-herser to say any of this. These are her words. But so she explicitly says, I don't want your brother to know that I messaged you. So what do you do? You post a public video about it. And now I know that she messaged you. How is this fair on her? You know how you know her. You know the first conversation you had with her. You know, and I know what was said. Do the right thing, own up to your mistakes and apologize. With my brother putting that tweet out, you're definitely going to get people who are going to lie about the situation just to make me look a lot worse. A lot worse. You don't think I didn't think of that. I definitely got a lot of crap from that tweet. But I also got a lot of women with real experiences with you with screenshots. I wasn't interested in talking to the girls unless they had some sort of evidence to back their story. Other girls have messaged me as well, showing me their DMs of my brother. I'm not going to show those DMs as this video is not an attack on my brother. Go ahead. Go ahead. Show all the DMs. Like I have literally nothing to hide. With my brother's video, if he does mention any lies or any form of manipulation or anything from the DMs that he's going to get, I will be forced to take legal action. I would much rather not do that, but I would be forced to take legal action for defamation of character. Like I said before, this is just an extreme action to take against claims that are supposedly not true. Then it means to take me to court over the anticipation of allegation. Just screams guilty. Besides, how are you going to take me to court when there's proof? I have evidence. You can't sue me for defamation of character if it's true. You're not even defending yourself anymore. You're just threatening me now. All he needs to do is just take responsibility. That's it. He's older than me. Just take responsibility. I said he's going to attack me. I haven't attacked you at all in this video, Dej. I have simply responded and defended myself from everything you have said in your video. I have taken responsibility. I now you need to do the same. Upon me uploading my video as well, my brother has started to distance himself from my parents to make them feel guilty for getting involved and preventing my brother destroying my livelihood and destroying my credibility. I'm not going to explain what he's doing, but that's what the level he's going. You're exaggerating this so far beyond from what it actually is. Let me explain what I'm doing. Our parents can't deal with our finances. Even before this whole situation blew up, I had started to feel like this wasn't such a good idea anymore. Stuff like this with family always gets complicated. To be honest, I just wanted my parents to be my parent again. I'm not just the countenance. And then with the past few months, it's just highlighted that I definitely do not want my parents to be in charge of my finances. I mean, our mom went into my private accounts to give my brother false information to use in a diss track that was public. I mean, that alone is just crazy. I just feel like I just need more control. I mean, I'm definitely not distancing myself in an attempt to make them feel guilty. I mean, why would you even suggest that? I mean, come on. This literally has nothing to do with you. You're literally trying to manipulate everyone in making me look like I'm going out of my way to hurt my parents. When you know nothing about the situation, all I'm doing is protecting myself and my finances from being burnt in the future. And that's it. I'm still going to talk to my parents. I'm still going to visit our parents. I'm still going to do activities with our parents. I'm just removing the financial side. I just want to remove any potential complications that come with it and just focus on being a family. And I know our family is going through a lot because of tank and that's why I also want to remove the hassle of doing my finances during this period. What my brother wants is he wants my parents to pick science. That's what he wants. You know what I want, Veg? I want you to stop saying my parents and instead say our parents. Because I am part of this family too. You have made me an outcast throughout all of this. We talked to any of our friends and asked them who has caused the most hassle. All of them will say you. You have literally made my life a living hell and all for what? Views? Subscribers? You always say that family comes first. But that's not true, is it? Huh? To you, to you, the fans come first. I've made so many attempts to try and fix our family issues. I've even suggested that we go see a therapist, but you're just refused. I'm just so tired of fighting a losing battle with my own family, man. I'm tired of feeling like an outcast. Yes, I can do better, but so can you, man. Like I'm at the point where I can't even take my own girlfriend to see my family because I'm scared that she's going to get exposed. And my brother is going to use that information against me. I'm scared to even text my family because I'm scared you're going to just screenshot the fucking message and just post it publicly. And I'm scared to even call my family because I'm scared you're going to just take one negative thing that I say, manipulate the audience and just make me look as bad as possible. I'm just sick and fucking tired of it. Like I shouldn't have to feel like this or even have these concerns. It's so ridiculous, man. And you can't expect me to just fix everything by myself. We need to do this as a family. We need to resolve all of our issues as a family. I've never been so happy. Honestly, I've never been so happy just going on social media and just seeing all the support that you guys have given me. I want to say thank you so much. Honestly, I thank you so much. So all the people who sent me a tweet sent me a DM message me on any social media that I have. I wanted to say thank you. Thank you. I really do appreciate it. I really do. This is the happiest you've ever been. Gaining subscribers at the expense of dragging your own brother makes you your happiest. Airing all of our issues publicly makes you your happiest. This type of video shouldn't make you happy at all. It should do the complete opposite. You should have told me privately how you've been feeling. For me, this response video doesn't make me happy at all. It makes me physically sick. This past week I've been on tour but the only thing that's been on my mind is your video man. I am sick and tired of this whole fucking situation. I just want it to fucking end man. None of this should have been made public. Either way I'm going to work on trying to resolve all of this. I love my family regardless of what I've been put through or what I've put dead you through. I'm going to work this out. They want to reply to this publicly but I had to defend myself just like you did with your video. I just want this to be over man. I just want this to be over and done with. So please let's just be done with this stage. And yeah man, I always love you. Yeah, what's that?"
037_Jaclyn,"Hey guys, welcome back to my channel. For today's video, I don't even need to give you an intro. You know why we are here. I want to address some of the issues that my customers are having with my first launch of my brand Jack and cosmetics and my lipsticks. First and foremost, I want to let you guys know the basis I'm going to be covering throughout this video. I want to talk about the melting issue. I want to talk about the white fuzzies. I want to talk about the black holes. I don't want to talk about the grittiness and the texture that you guys are experiencing and give you informed details of what all of these issues are, what is causing them and how they are going to be fixed. I just want to put that out there before you've been jumping into the actual video so that you guys know that I'm not going to run away from this. And I know it's taken me a couple days to get all my ducks in a row and get this video out for you guys. But I've been going through all the documentation and on the phone with labs and chemists in the owner of my lab and my entire team for several days and doing a very in-depth investigation to figure out exactly what's going on so that I can give you the most informed information as a brand owner. The first thing that I want to address before anything else is the accusations that my lipsticks are expired, moldy or hazardous in any way, shape or form. I'm going to put up documents throughout this entire video so you guys can see the actual proof because I'm not going to sit here and like read papers to you guys. I'm going to put it right there on the screen so you can see proof. So number one, let's start with the expired accusation. My lipsticks did not go into mass production until the same month that I actually launched my brand. It was only a couple weeks before, a couple weeks prior to my launch that we started actual mass production. Although I had been so in-depth with my formulation, my colors and approving all of that, mass production did not go into production until right before my launch because we wanted them to be fresh. We didn't want them to sit on shelves and because my brand has been pushed back so many times, I actually already went through the same situation with a different lab several years ago. I went into mass production and ended up having an issue while in mass production and then didn't launch my brand and had to go to a whole new lab because I didn't want those issues to happen again. So I canceled them and went somewhere else. I tried to cover my tracks, I fucked up, but they are not expired. I know you guys have seen photos of my components all over my socials here and there throughout the last couple of years. I have been working on my components for five years straight to get it perfect but just because I've been working on a component, you guys have seen that does not mean that there's an actual lipstick inside of it that I kept on a shelf and sold to you guys. Just want to put that out there and know my intentions and what's real, what's not and give you the facts. Second of all, my lipsticks are not moldy. They are not hazardous, they are not contaminated, they're not unsafe for you in any way, shape or form. Every single ingredient in my lipstick is new and it is FDA approved and again, I will give you proof right here if you guys want to look over these documents in depth and tear them apart. You go right ahead and see that they are not contaminated. Every single ingredient is FDA approved and they are not expired. I want to ease your minds with that before even getting into all the nitty-gritty stuff of this video so that you're not sitting here thinking like, oh my gosh, is it true that if I use this lipstick that it's going to hurt me in some way? No, that is not the case and now you guys have seen that so let's move forward. All right, so the first thing I want to touch base on are the little black dots or black holes that you guys are seeing. What these black dots are are actually oxygen bubbles and they are being lifted to the service when my lipstick bullet is being cooled off. When it's going from a hot temperature, fresh out of the vat and it's going to go into my actual component and just be cooled down so that the component cap can be put on top in that process. Sometimes those oxygen bubbles don't make it all the way through and you'll see little 80-bitty almost like black like holes. It's not actually black holes. Again, it's not mold. It is oxygen and it is 100% safe. It is not going to hurt you, but seeing those dots are not pretty and they're not like, you don't look at that component, you don't look at that lipstick and think like, oh yeah, I want to put this on my lips. So if you're experiencing that, please contact help at JacquelineCosmetics.com. Show us a photo of your product. We will send you not only a full refund, but we will also give you a brand new lipstick that does not have any of those issues that you're concerned about. The second thing I want to touch on is the texture and the grittiness that you guys are seeing in your lipsticks. Now, although this is not happening to everybody, it's still happening. And basically, what this is caused from is the humongous vats. It's almost like, I always want to use the word beaker, but it's not like a beaker or smaller. It's like these gigantic huge vats there in labs. It's like this gigantic thing that holds all of your lipstick and it like spins like this and mixes everything up. That that is not breaking down all my raw materials because we produce so many lipsticks so quickly. Again, all the products in these vats are 100% FDA approved ingredients and totally good and safe for you to use, but they're not being broken down small enough and smoothly enough, which I take full responsibility for. We made a lot of product in a very short amount of time. And although we all thought that it was going to be perfect and fresh, that's not the case. We move too quickly. And because of that, the ingredients are not broken down. I will say this, you're still going to get the same effect on your lips. They're still going to give you a nice creamy formulation. It's still going to look beautiful once supplied, but it's not pretty to look at. And when you apply it, sometimes you can feel like a little bit of that texture and that grittiness and that is so not okay. And I want to make that right for you. And again, I'm going to reiterate it over and over and over to contact help at jaclancosmetics.com. Of course, I will put that email in the video. I'll put it down below. Contact them. All you need to do is show them any proof of video, a photo, whatever it is. And we will take care of everything for you and make it right. I know that a lot of people are like, yeah, what if people are lying? I don't even care. Like I want to make this right for my customers. This is my first launch. And it's very embarrassing. I'm not going to make it about myself in any way until you how I feel about this. But it's embarrassing for me to not see you guys fully happy. And I am so so sorry that any of you are experiencing anything less than absolute perfection from my first launch. And I will do whatever it takes to make it up for you. I will send you a brand new lipstick. I will pay for it myself. I'll give you a full refund. I don't care. I want you guys to experience the products that I approved, that I love, and what I want to create for my brand going forward. Next, let's talk about the white fuzzies. This is the thing that gets me going. So when I first heard the definition and the reason for these white fuzzies on some of these lipsticks, I 100% did not believe it. I got very upset. And I was like, why are you lying to me? Why are you trying to treat me like I'm an idiot? This is ridiculous. Like I need a better explanation. But after throw investigation, we know what the actual issue is. And I know that a lot of you guys are going to have a hard time believing this because I did as well. This is the truth because my lipstick component is a silver, shiny, almost metal-like material. My lab instead of using a standard glove that they would use in the lab, they decided to use white cotton gloves. They're like fluffy white gloves because they didn't want the standard gloves to put any smears on this component to in any way have any sort of prints on it. So they wanted to do a white fluffy glove. First, when I heard this, I thought, but wait, how are a couple people wearing white fluffy glove gloves going to put this many fluffy white little fuzzies all over my product? That doesn't make sense, right? Well, then once I started seeing videos and I started seeing proof and then my team actually did our own investigation. It actually made a lot more sense in my mind and I'll tell you guys exactly what that is. We have several people up to 20 people working on my lipsticks on the line every single day as they are being produced and every single of those people are wearing white gloves. When I tell you guys how many times a day they have to change gloves and put on new ones, it's crazy. Every time I need to take a call, they have to step off the floor, off the line, out of the production area. They have to take off their gloves and they have to get brand new ones when they walk back in. They have to take off their hair nuts, they take off their beard nuts, they have to replace everything once they come back in. They don't get to walk out, go to the bathroom, put on the same gloves and come back in. So when you think about 15, 20 people working on a line, all replacing their gloves every 30 minutes, 45 minutes, hour, hour and a half, it's a lot of brand new, freshly white gloves coming in to that region that is spreading over the product, not acceptable. At all, in the second we saw this, we changed two different gloves that will not be giving this issue whatsoever. On top of that, they were cleaning my vats, which is the big humongous bucket that has my batches inside of it. They were cleaning those vats with like this white fiber almost towel going through it. And that's been happening about once a day they said to sometimes twice a day depending how quickly you're moving through batches. So those two things combined, that is what you are experiencing are little white cotton fibers coming off of their gloves. And it is so beyond unacceptable. And I am so sorry this happened to you guys. And for obvious reasons, we will no longer be making any more products with this lab because that's just not what you guys deserve. So again, contact me and my team. We will get you a full refund and a new perfect bullet that does not look like that. But let me just say this, it is not harmful for you. This is not an anyway harmful. It's just little white cotton fuzzies that come from a very sterile environment. Still not okay. But I just want you guys to know that if it doesn't bother you, it doesn't bother you. Like I've had several people contact me. They're like, oh, I don't care. I just wiped it off and used it. And I'm like, that's fine. But still it's not perfect. And it's not what I want for my product. So contact Jaclyn Cosmetics and we will figure it out and we'll make it right. Lastly, I want to talk about the melting issue. And even though you guys are seeing a lot of stuff all over social media, like when I log on to social media, I'm just like, oh my god. But from the back end of my brand and actually looking at emails, the biggest issue and the biggest complaint is actually the melting issue. It's actually 80% of our complaints is melting. And I know it's crazy, right? You would think that like the grittiness and all that other stuff. But no, all the other stuff is only 20%, which is insane because social media is so loud and out there. And it looks like it's so aggressive and so terrible. But behind the scenes of what I'm seeing, I'm like, all right, please contact me if you're having an issue reach out. Like I want to fix it for you. You know, like I want to prove myself to you. And I thought that I was going to do that when I first launched. But I messed up and I made mistakes. And for that, I am so sorry. But please allow me to help make this right for you. Anyways, about the melting situation, which is about 80% of complaints, like I said, people are receiving some lipsticks in the mail and then they pull them out. They twist them up. They swatch them. They break. They break in the center. As you twist them up all the way, they'll break at the base, which is pretty standard. Even if you don't have a melted lipstick, if you roll all the way up and you swatch it, chances are if it's an emollient base lipstick, it's going to break at the base. So make sure that when you use your lipsticks, you do not roll up fully all the way when you are using it, just a side note. But what people are experiencing is it's showing up in the mail and it's almost having like a little sweat mark, like a little like circular sweat mark or like little like sweat dots. And then when you swatch it, the lips that kind of leans to the side and then it's got like a little little line on it because it's a very creamy, very emollient base product. So you really have to make sure that it's fully cooled down before using it. We did an extensive test on my lipsticks and shipping from here to there and all this jazz. But because of the climate right now, we are shipping to some people who are in such hot temperatures and such high degree that my lipsticks, they're not surviving it fully. My testing actually came out to about 140 degrees Fahrenheit, which means that my specific lipstick can withstand 140 degrees before actually melting all the way through, which is a very high temperature. But once these lipsticks are getting onto trucks that are, you know, 100 degrees on the inside, these UPS trucks, and then they're sitting outside of people's houses out there front doors while they're at work, and then they come home and they pull it out. Yes, they're not fully melted all the way through, and just like a puddle inside. But yeah, they might have little sweat dots on them. When you swatch them, they might kind of lean to the side. So please give your lipsticks enough time to fully cool off before you go in and apply it. We are working on a solution for that for you guys right now, though. So that again, you're not dealing with anything that's going to dissatisfied you. Like, I just want to make sure that you guys are happy. That's all it matters to me. And if there's anything that I'm not covering in this video that I haven't seen on social media, please again, contact my team and I and we will take care of you. Now that I have been like spaszing going through all of this because I'm just so eager to get this video up, I really just want to take a moment to genuinely thank those of you who have reached out to me, telling me what's going on. And everyone on Twitter and Instagram who are genuinely sending me photos, like asking me and concerned, I am very grateful for your honesty. I'm very grateful for you coming forward and telling me what's going on because I want to fix this. And I would never know if you guys didn't keep me informed. So I want to say thank you very much to everybody who has come forth because I did an interview about my brand a couple months ago. And that's what I said in this interview. I said that my number one thing is I want my subscribers to be honest with me. I want them to tell me genuinely what they feel about my product so that I can I can continue to take your information and move forward with it and give you the best products that you guys could receive. Like, that's very important to me. And I'm very sorry that this launch was not absolutely 100% perfect with a bow on it. But we will make it right for you and going forward. We will no longer be experiencing these experiences that we are having. We are taking drastic measures to change that and make sure that everything is amazing for you. I actually have had to pull several launches because I was doing them with this lab that I had coming up and had to change labs on several different products. So there's going to be a slight delay in some things later on, but that doesn't matter. Like, I just want to make sure that you guys are receiving the best of the absolute best. So in the future, even if you choose not to be a Jaclyn Cosmetics customer, even if you lose trust to me, that's okay. Like, I understand. I promise you guys all around the board, perfect products, and not all of them were all around the board, perfect products. So I get it. But I'm going to work very hard and I'm going to work very diligently to make sure that within the next couple of months, within the next year, you're going to look at my brand and be like, oh, wow, this actually is good. Like, she actually corrected her error and she learned from her mistakes because it's exactly what I'm going to do. And I'm so sorry for anyone who received anything less than perfect. I take full responsibility. This is my brand with my name on it and my team that I've created. And I am so sorry that you've received something that is not exactly how I described it to you. So that's it. I love you. Thank you for watching. Thank you for listening. Thank you for understanding contact help at Jaclyncosmetics.com and we will be back to you shortly. I love you so much. And I'll be seeing you soon."
038_Jared,"Hey, it's me. And I was lied to. And so were you. It's been a tumultuous last few months to say the least. And I don't know how else to describe what I watched other than sheer disbelief. For those of you who are unaware a few months ago, some individuals circulated serious accusations against me. And I want to make it perfectly clear right now, they are false. And I have proof. I have the receipts. I know a lot of people have been wondering why I've been silent and why it's taken me three months to say something. These allegations need to be taken seriously. I spent this entire time talking to as many people as I could. Lawyers, law experts, officials, anyone. And I wasn't going to do anything until I was certain that it would be safe to talk about. Thankfully it is. So here I am. Besides I saw how the internet responded. Three months ago I was demonized and dehumanized. People were understandably angry. And a few things I did try to post were met with outrage. And a few people who tried to speak out on my behalf were threatened into silence. And they only stopped out of fear. Fear of the internet. And what I'm hoping for now is that at least a few people are willing to listen. I mean, you're here. So thank you for hearing me out. And I've already seen a lot of posts from people telling me to move on or that the T is cold. I'm sorry that this is no longer entertaining for them. But just because they're bored of it doesn't mean that the harassment stopped or that the story is final and over. What this all came down to was people saying that I was exchanging nudes with fans on Snapchat and Tumblr. And a lot of people want to know if I did any of that. Yeah, I did. And I always made it clear that it was for consenting adults only. This came about when numerous people had asked me about it and wanted to know if it was okay to do. I said yes, that it would be a safe place for people who wish to express themselves in that way and for me to express myself in that way. It was an open invitation for those who wanted to do it and that I wouldn't be offended or upset and that nothing would be shared or saved without explicit permission. To be clear, it was an open invitation to those who wanted to participate. The choice was always up to them. At no point did I ever go through my followers list and single out individuals or screen names and pursue them. I never did that. I always left the choice up to them. Let them choose to engage or not to initiate or have nothing at all. I made a conscious effort to treat everyone with the same respect always. And I see no shame what goes on between consenting adults. It was never meant to be an abuse of power. I never offered anyone anything in return, like making them a twitch mod or early access to a YouTube video or whatever. I also never threatened anyone, any kind of punishment if they didn't or anything like that. However, I want to acknowledge now that there was a power imbalance. That comes down to who I am and what I do. Even if there was nothing offered in return, there was still incentive for people to do it because I am a YouTuber. It doesn't matter how neutral the intent was, just being in this position causes a power imbalance. A lot of people saw that and were upset at me for that reason. Into those of you who feel that way, I completely understand how you feel and why you feel that way. I feel that what I was doing was not predatory, but it was unhealthy. But that isn't the main grievance that everyone has with me. It's the other allegations by these two. They're both named Charlie, which is going to be confusing. So for the one from the UK, I'm going to use his nickname, which is Chai. Their tweets were some serious accusations and I'll go over them, but they both basically boiled down to the same thing. That they were underage that I knew this and that I was okay with it and encouraged them to interact with me. I'm going to show you exactly how these accusations are inaccurate or just flat out lies. The key word that they allege is that I did all of this knowingly and intentionally, which is false. For example, if we go to Chai's accusations, we can see that, ah, never mind, he deleted his accusations. Well, that's okay because we can still go to Charlie's Twitter and we can see. That, ah, wait, they deleted theirs too. This is the equivalent of firing a gun and then trying to hide it while it's still smoking. And for the record, they both deleted their tweets shortly after their narratives were questioned. You know, posted out there just long enough, but that's okay. Like I said, I have the receipts. The most prominent accusation was the first one from Chai. I'm going to make this available for everyone to read, but I'm just going to paraphrase for now. What it claims is that he had sent me nudes while telling me he was only 16 and I said that I was okay with that and continued to spur him on. It's also important to note that he states that he has no evidence of us ever interacting. So all we have to go on is his word. And in an instance such as this where he has no evidence, my word is just as valid as his. And here's the thing with that. I don't remember ever talking to this person. None of what he claims sounds familiar to my memory at all. The actions he describes doesn't sound like something I would ever do. Something in it sounds right or familiar. And through everything that I scoured with any and all possible correspondences that I could have access to, I found nothing with Chai whatsoever. What this leaves us with is his word versus mine, which gets us nowhere. And as the internet has shown me, people are more likely to believe whoever fires first on Twitter. After all, while what he accused me, unless I'm guilty. So my word is I don't remember this even happening or even talking to this person. And Chai's word is that all of this did happen. So rather than making it Chai's word versus mine, it should be Chai's word versus Chai's word. In his accusations, Chai sets the timeframe for when all of this supposedly happened. Early 2016, specifically sometime between March and July. This is all very important. He also makes it clear that this happened sometime before my personal Tumblr account that he supposedly interacted with me on was hacked and deleted. And my Tumblr was hacked. I can confirm that. There are even tweets to timestamp when that happened, which is mid-May 2016. This puts the timeframe based on his claims sometime between March 2016 and May 2016. Again, this is all very important. Are you familiar with the website medium.com? It's a website in which people can write articles and blog posts for public viewing. Chai has quite a few of them on there and a couple of them are relevant to this situation, especially this one titled, I've been disabled for two years. I'm not going to read every part of it because not everything in here is pertinent, but I'll make a link available so that if you want, you can read through all of it. The 9th of November 2015 is the most notable date in my life and always will be. Most people remember their wedding day or their 18th birthday or the day someone close to them died. For me, I remember the day of my accident. We were playing basketball. I loved basketball. My height was my downfall as it turned out. I was running to try and get the ball from someone. I ran, I ran, boom. I fell down hard, landing on my knees and snapping my head forward so that my forehead smacked against the floor. It was almost the end of the lesson so I asked to be excused to the changing room. The rest of the class came in and we all started getting changed. That's the last thing I properly remember until about six months later. As we were changing, I apparently fainted, landing hard on the concrete floor and smashing the back of my head off of it. I was taken to a hospital, admitted to the Children's Ward, given an EEG and MRI a cardiogram. I was tentatively told that I had axonal brain damage and after a couple of days sent home. Q. Another Passing Out. Another Hospitalization. I passed out again while in the hospital. At this point in my life, I was sleeping for around 16 to 18 hours per day. I had to stop going to school and was essentially bedbound, along with the pain, came voices, hallucinations. I didn't notice them so much at first or attributed them to being so tired, seeing a spider when there was none or a flash of light. Then things got a bit more intense. Kill someone. Stab your mom. Grab that steak knife and stick it in his back. I was terrified of myself. All day, every day, I was plagued with thoughts of violence and aggression. They got harder and harder to ignore. Listing your symptoms over and over gets pretty exhausting. Fatigue, severe head pain, spasms of pain. Extremely bad short-term memory. Big gaps in long-term memory. No concentration, occasionally passing out, psychosis. Went forward to August 2016. The psychosis was getting worse. One night, I walked downstairs, opened the living room door, and told my mom that she needed to take me to the hospital because if she didn't, I'd kill her. Literally kill her. The nights I spent in the hospital for psychosis were the worst nights of my life. My miracle came a few days into my hospital's day. After about five minutes of terrible, awful, exhausting pain, it stopped. I released my whole body, something felt different. It was silent. The voices had gone. In his own article, Chi states that he suffered a traumatic brain injury and has no memory for six months from November 2015 up until May 2016. He continued to have hallucinations and psychosis up until August 2016. And if you are not familiar with psychosis, psychosis is an abnormal condition of the mind that results in difficulties determining what is real and what is not. Symptoms may include false beliefs and seeing or hearing things that others do not see are here, aka hallucinations. To reiterate, Chi's accusation was that the things I supposedly did happened between March 2016 and May 2016. Chi also states that he has no memory during this exact same period and hallucinations continuing until August 2016. My word was that I don't remember ever talking to this person, recognizing them, or finding the behavior that they described as something that I would even do. So I asked you to draw your own conclusion here. Did this actually happen? There is a possibility to consider that the hospital stay and the memory loss isn't true, that it was made up to garner sympathy. And if that's the case, how can we trust Chi's story about me? And if the hospital stay and memory loss story is true, how can we trust Chi's story about me? Again, I ask you, did his claims actually happen? I'll offer one final piece of conjecture. My tumbler was hacked. The hacker was seeking to deal as much damage as possible. They were posting really grotesque things, rapid fire. They had full access to my posts, to my inbox, and to my private messages. If they were seeking to deal as much damage as possible, they would have gone through my private conversations and leaked damaging things. But nothing was leaked. Again, I ask you, do you still feel that Chi's claims against me? Beyond a reasonable doubt actually happened. Something that's important to note is the way Chi and Charlie made their statements. They use a logical fallacy known as poisoning the well. It's a tactic in which, before you are presented with information, you are given subtext, opinions, or other relevant information to negatively affect your opinion about something before you find out what this something is. In other words, to manipulate you. And it worked on everybody. Charlie's accusations quickly followed Chi's. They had their own story posted to Twitter and it had very similar claims that they were underage, that they interacted with me, and that I never even asked them for their age. Charlie was able to back up their accusations by posting several screenshots of our messages onto Twitter. Like I just mentioned, each screenshot is accompanied with them providing subtext and opinions to poison the well before you even look at it. Unlike Chi, I actually do remember talking to Charlie. It seemed familiar, but what they are saying didn't sound right. All of these images and poisoned well tactics that they posted on Twitter are the exact same things that they had emailed out to business associates of mine. I'm going to go more into that in a little bit, but basically they emailed people that I know with these exact same screenshots and said the same things pretty much verbatim as to what they put on Twitter. This is relevant because this is one of the screens they put on Twitter. And this is the exact same screen included in those emails. Only Charlie's Tumblr name isn't redacted. Now because they have these, it's very clear that Charlie had access to our entire conversation on Tumblr and they would have been able to see everything. But they still chose to only show carefully selected and carefully cropped images. This was done to make me look as bad as possible and to mislead you. For example, if Charlie would have shown the very start of our messages, you would have seen where Charlie lied. To clear up the immediate confusion as to why my screenshot has a different profile picture for me in it is because I had updated my profile picture sometime in February or March of this year. It's the same profile picture that's over on my Twitch page. All this means is that Charlie had taken the screen caps sometime before I updated my profile picture. Every single part of Charlie's allegations against me hinges on the belief that I didn't know their age and or didn't ask. They even argued that I should have known their age because they used the phrase, I am a baby as if this somehow denotes how old they generally are even though it's used in a context of shyness or feeling intimidated. And I did ask their age and they lied. They also clearly knew then that they were doing something they know they shouldn't and is doing something they know I'm not okay with. They had full access to the entire conversation and admitted to all of you that they lied to me deceiving all of you. They knew about this from the get go, which is why on Twitter they immediately began to back pedal on their claims, changing their tone from claiming I didn't say he knew my age. I said he was predatory. Every behavior would be targeting an individual and pursuing after them often repeatedly. And as Charlie had access to our whole conversation, they saw it was them who continued to initiate conversations with me unprompted numerous times for months along. But Charlie chose to admit that and when they spoke with the daily beast, they lied in the interview about me never asking for their age. And I did so this is libel. Kenoban Bauer could have asked for my ID and they could have not lied. This isn't about whether or not they remembered if I asked them or not. It's that they knew that I asked because they clearly had access to all of our messages and saw their truth. Now this does bring up the question why didn't I ask for people's IDs? And the answer is because that would be asking people to dox themselves, which seems far more risky. Besides, there's no way to verify IDs and it's very easy for people to photoshop up one in minutes. And if someone is going to lie to get somewhere, they're going to lie. By the way, Charlie also would have seen that in our entire conversation, I never sent them a dick pick. So all these beliefs that Jared sent nudes to minors is factually untrue. Even the claims that I was manipulative or coarse them are untrue because I made it consistently clear as I did with everyone else that it was their choice if they wanted to every time. More accurately, it was Charlie who manipulated me and all of you with their lies. These allegations against me about being a predator against underage people are fundamentally false. Charlie and Chai began making these accusations against me back at the end of March, beginning of April this year. They were smearing my name back then by sending an email out with everything that you've seen already. The first people they sent these accusations out to was the Game Grumps, not the police or law enforcement or the person I was married to at the time, but the Game Grumps. This can be easily proven with a tweet Chai made to Aaron Hansen of the Game Grumps at the end of March about the email. This Twitter account of Chai's was suspended shortly after for harassment. From around April 2nd, the Game Grumps private it every single video they've ever done with me because they believed the poison well and didn't ask me about it. The next day I was shown the email and honestly, even I believed it. None of it sounded right to me, but if they were saying this, I must have done this, right? It must be true. So I apologized to them. It upset Charlie and Chai that I got in contact with them and tried to apologize. They called my apology manipulative. Here's the thing. I apologized to them because they wanted me to. Let's go back to the email that they sent out to the Game Grumps. At the very end, Chai and Charlie state in that email that ideally they'd like me to always check the age of the people I'm talking to sexually, which I did, and to apologize to Chai and Charlie. So I did. But now let's look at the email that they sent to normal boots a couple of days later. Scroll down to the very same section and they deleted the part where they wanted me to apologize. They then weaponized my apology against me on Twitter after asking for it. That is literally manipulation. Now once I broke out publicly, normal boots did post-estatement that I was no longer a part of their team. I was not fired. I resigned so that everyone else at normal boots wouldn't get dragged down with me. I was already seeing the negativity in all of their videos and some of them started losing subscribers. I left in the hopes that they wouldn't take any more additional collateral damage. The last thing I want to note about this email is that Chai and Charlie made it clear that they worked on it together and Charlie lied about their claims. This doesn't automatically disprove Chai, but their close friendship and one of them being a liar does cast further doubt on Chai's claims, especially since he has no evidence. How can we trust Chai when his cohort Charlie was already lying? Something I've been trying to figure out through all of this is why would they even do this? Why make such dishonest claims? But for as much as I have molded over, I can only come down to the most logical conclusion, which is also the simplest. Money and attention. It's very clear that they both adore attention and desired it from the internet and especially from the game grumps. Both of them are massive fans of the grumps. This is really easy to see from Chai having another article on medium about meeting your idols and talks about meeting the game grumps the entire time. Charlie has another tumbler called EgoBanked dedicated to sexual fantasies of Dan and Aaron, fanfictions, fan art and discussions of them having sex with each other, along with Charlie talking about their own sexual experiences, desires and fantasies, which also contradicts their claim of being inexperienced, innocent or a baby. Charlie even tweeted at Ross of the game grumps about watching a gay porn with an actor who looks just like him in 2015. The grab for attention ultimately proved successful. Both of them got a large influx of new Twitter followers as even denoted by Charlie and it was even better for Chai since his previous Twitter account just got suspended. It even got them the attentions of their idols that they adored and all of this gives them clout in social credits. Crats that give them a degree of having a form of notoriety and believability and admiration for taking down the bad guy. They both were aware of this and tried to capitalize on it. While all the drama was going on, Chai tweeted out links to his Amazon wish list, his paypal and to his coffee, and kept it pinned there for weeks. Even tweeted about it again at the end of May. Charlie's pinned tweet and it's still there is a link to their commissions page for art and on this page is a link for donations which goes straight to their paypal. This isn't a coincidence. They've both shown a repeated behavior of e-begging. There's a tweet Charlie made to Chai's now suspended Twitter account last year about Chai suddenly becoming famous and how he should link his paypal. Going back for a moment to Charlie's ego-banged porn blog, they've posted on there asking for commissions in May of 2017 and again the next month only this time asking for direct donations. This post asking for money got near 1400 notes which is huge for Tumblr. While saying, help me, I'm a baby. This shows that e-begging can be successful. Asking for money or asking for commissions to draw porn. Chai and Charlie were not the only accusations of inappropriate behavior that came out. As all of this was unfolding, Pamela Horton tweeted out her own statements. I will discuss those as well. If you're not familiar with Pamela, she is currently a member of the YouTube channel Toaster Ghost and was formerly a model for Playboy's gamer next door. Her statement alleges that at an Nintendo event in early 2015 that both she and I were attending, I looked up her nudes and forcefully showed them to a group of gentlemen also attending the event. The event she's speaking of was a special preview event for the first platoon game when it's going to be released for the Wii U, which is also where Pamela and I first met. This is confirmed by Amelia Talon, a coworker of Pamela's at Playboy who I also met there for the first time. When I first saw this, I had no idea what she was talking about. I don't remember doing anything of that sort that entire weekend. Again, this isn't something I would do. It was really confusing, considering the numerous occasions after this event that Pamela and I were both that and were very friendly and imicable. I never had any sense of discomfort or disapproval from her. So I had to ask other people what she's even talking about just to find out what she was referring to. This statement was written in such a way as to make it seem as if she was present during the supposed instance and witnessed it, which she was not. She also left out a lot of details so that the story couldn't be verified, such as the gentleman in question. So I'll name them. Gerard the completionist, another person who requested to remain anonymous and Matsuhinki, formerly of Smosh Games and now of Toaster Ghost. I'm saying I didn't do this. The anonymous person said he doesn't remember me doing this. Gerard said he doesn't remember me doing this and knows it's not something that I would do, which leads me to believe that Pamela heard about this from Sohinki. So of the four gentlemen present, three of the four say it didn't happen. I will tell you what I do remember happening while the four of us gentlemen were hanging out in one of our hotel rooms one of the evenings. Somebody had mentioned that Pamela has a Bayonetta cosplay. I believe with Sohinki who mentioned that, but I'm I'm I'm I'm unsure on that detail. At the time, I had a vested interest in cosplay due to my relationship with a cosplayer. So I remember looking up Pamela's costume and I remember being audibly excited after I realized I had just seen Pamela as Bayonetta at E3 2014 where she was modeling the costume promoting Bayonetta 2 for the Wii U. I think this whole thing was a misunderstanding or misrememberance. I know what I did not do. I did not scour the internet for her nudes and then forcefully show them to a friend of mine and two strangers at the time. But that's not the end of her accusations. She goes on to talk about how I continue to show her disrespect, refusing to shake her hand and making lute comments about her and ignoring her in a group setting. Again, these details are vague and again, I don't know what she's talking about. I had to ask around just to find out what she was even referring to. And what I found out was that she was specifically referring to my behavior at E3 a few years ago during a panel that consisted of myself, Pamela and Matt Pat. Here's a thing with that. I've never done a panel with Matt Pat. I've never done a panel with Pamela. I've never done a panel with Matt Pat and Pamela together. I've never done a panel at E3. This couldn't have happened because the circumstances in which they did don't exist. And if you don't believe me on that, that's okay. Just Matt Pat, a third party there, supposedly present, when this happened. And if it does exist, please find it. If it was done at E3, it was recorded or live streamed and saved somewhere. Please find it. I would love to see it because I don't know what she's talking about. If it exists, I will gladly eat my words and apologize. But I know that it doesn't. I have to admit here that I don't personally know Pamela that well. We've hung out a few social gatherings while I was in Los Angeles and we were always cordled with each other. However, I don't believe that Pamela is a liar. I think this is something that probably actually happened to her and she was treated with some amount of disrespect. But she's putting me in the place of someone who actually treated her this way. I am choosing to believe that she isn't just making stuff up. The outrage and the response of the internet was formed entirely by misinformation and by using false equality by saying, well, this part is true. Therefore, this part must also be true. But people ran with a narrative formed by layers upon layers of accusations without facts. This was perpetuated until it became the truth. But it wasn't the truth. And that didn't matter. It wasn't important if it was true or not. A mob was beating me down and everyone jumped in on it. Everyone wanted to show that they had the moral high ground by kicking me while I was down. Making memes, clown emojis, and jokes to essentially virtue signal that they are somehow better than me, without all the facts, all for the congratulations of anonymous internet strangers. YouTubers that I've never even heard of and who I imagine never heard of me, lashed out at me and made jokes at my expense. Some of them harassed me overtly. Others did it subtly. But let's call it what it really is. It's bullying. Imagine them walking down the street and seeing a group of people beating someone down to the ground to the point that he's helpless and immobile. And without even knowing anything of the situation or what the truth even is, they joined in on it just so that they could feel better than the person they were punching down on. It was amazing seeing the sheer amount of coverage on drama YouTube channels. Dozens of them all wang in from a supposed neutral stance. Not one of them tried to reach out to me. Not one of them tried to ask me, hey, is any of this true? What's your side of the story? They aren't interested in truth or being fair. They wanted to click. And because of that, they further perpetuated misinformation and stirred up a mob. I already know people are moving their goalposts so that they can continue to condemn me by saying, oh, well, he's still a cheater. No cheating happened. I told my wife of the time that I no longer wanted to be with her in October of 2018. I was refused. I was told no. I was denied. I had my career threatened. I felt controlled. I sought therapists and lawyers to assist in separating retried discernment therapy to no avail. I have texts from that time that show I was refused and that it was just going to be taken as a warning. I now have texts between myself and a professional third party well aware of the entire situation that shows I was trying to end it around that time. Holly is being called a home record, which is such an antiquated term. And it makes it seem like that I had no power or choice or agency in my own relationship, which is not true. It was my choice to not be in that relationship anymore. And Holly didn't cheat on Ross. Ross knows literally everything. He knew everything was going on with me and Holly. He knew everything that was going on with my personal relationship. Ross even flew up to see me in March of 2018 to support me. He had some other goals that weekend, but he did make it a point to see me, to encourage me, and to support me. And Ross moved out and left Holly while she was away at Pax West last year. So to say that she cheated on him is wholly inaccurate. And quite frankly, none of that should matter. Breakups happen. Sometimes relationships don't work out. And anything to do with that is none of your business. So what about the people who still want to support me? What can you do? Well, it would mean a lot to me if you could watch my YouTube videos again, either on this channel over, over on the gameplay channel. It would mean a lot to me if you would watch my Twitch streams. Since I'll probably be there a bit more since it doesn't require as much emotional energy as making YouTube videos. There's a petition to get dice camera action back on the air. If you want to follow that link in the description and sign that, I would really appreciate it. If you want, you can try to help combat all the misinformation that's still being spread around, either by sharing this video or engaging ill-informed people respectfully. And that's not going to be easy. There's going to be a lot of cognitive dissonance and the fear of social exclusion. It's going to be painful for some people, like a gear in their head, suddenly going in the opposite direction. Nobody likes hearing that they're wrong. Be kind and be patient. If you would like to do more research on your own to continue being informed, there are a few places that I can point out. The original projairs subreddit was vandalized a hell and locked down and the mods removed me from it and are refusing to relinquish control. So the projaird2 subreddit has a lot of discussion and additional information. There is a truth blog about the whole ordeal that is trying to make sense of it all. They're doing a pretty good job. They don't have everything, but they're doing a pretty good job. And there are a couple of YouTube videos that are mostly accurate. I'd also like to humbly request to stop harassing me. To don't harass Holly. Don't harass Heidi. Don't harass my friends, especially those who try to stand up for me. Don't harass anybody. I know a lot of people reacted very emotionally to all of this and they may have said or done things that they now regret. And if this someone is you, I want you to know, I forgive you. And I hope that you can forgive me for anything too. And there will still be people who are still angry about it or won't accept the nude's blog thing or whatever. And that's okay. They are allowed to feel how they feel. I'm not going anywhere. I'm still going to be making videos talking about Final Fantasy or D&D or Magic De Gathering or whatever else that I want. I'll still be streaming. I'll still be doing my thing. I do have one more request. The next time you see someone being canceled with the mob attacking them and going after them, ask, what's the other side story? Is there more to this? How do you know they deserve to be bullied and shamed through evidence or through public opinion? Nobody likes cancel culture. Until they get an opportunity to cancel someone."
039_Brooke,"First, I want to start this video by saying thank you. I want to say thank you to anyone who has reached out about this topic or engaged in this discussion over the past month or so. I just want to genuinely say thank you because I think as a society, it is so important that we continue to talk about things we feel need to be talked about and discuss issues we feel need to be discussed. And so thank you for that. And I also want to apologize to anyone who was offended. It has never been and will never be my intention to hurt or offend anyone, ever. I'm not gonna sit here and try to justify my actions. I'm just not gonna do that. But what I will say is I have never intentionally willfully or maliciously hurt an animal and I never will. What I have done, however, is I have taken this time, this past month or so, to further educate myself in animal training and in animals in general. And I'm now a volunteer at a local animal welfare organization and so I'm really happy and excited about that. And since the matter, I have invested in professional dog training, I'm learning so much and I promise you that my pet owner relationship is stronger than ever. The trainer is absolutely amazing and it's just perfect. It's exactly what I needed. I have been in direct contact with LAPD since the matter for anyone wondering. And honestly, every day I'm just trying to continue to better myself as a dog owner. So thank you for speaking out about things that matter to you. I don't know if anyone has ever said this. This might sound kind of weird, but... If it sounds weird, don't fucking say it, please. I just wanna encourage you that if you see me in public, I want you to come up to me. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. How have genuine conversation with me? I would love to get to know you and I would love for you to get to know me. I'm pretty sure no genuine conversation with you is not gonna end with a person yelling to you about 110 times in a row. And for any YouTuber or other entity, influencers or other public figures even who have commented on this situation, I pray, I pray that one day we can meet because I would love to show you who I really am and I would love to show you my true heart and personality. For anyone who's going to ask if this video happens to get monetized, which I don't think it will, and the off-chance that it does get monetized, all proceeds are going to go to a local animal welfare organization in Southern California, point blank period, that's where all the proceeds will go if this video does get monetized. Just because I know people are going to ask and again, I don't think this video will be monetized, but in the off-chance that it does, all proceeds will be happily donated to an animal welfare organization in Southern California. Last thing I wanna say before I go is thank you so much to everyone who has continued to support me. I love you so much. And... It's just meant the world to me over this time. So I just wanna say thank you. And again, I wanna say thank you to everyone who has commented on this situation and has spoken out about things that are important to them and things that matter to them. Thank you. Besides that, I will talk to you guys very soon and thank you for listening. Bye."
040_Trisha,"Hey guys, it's up the morning. It's Tuesday and I just thought I'd check here. I am just overwhelmed by the amount of backlash. I obviously... I put up a video in no way because I think I would get so much backlash and hate and a ton of hate from the LGBTQ community. And that alone breaks my heart so much because I just... I never would want to offend that community that I've been so like... strongly for and admired and loved and allied with for so long and especially the transgender community. I haven't watched Gigi's video but Gigi called me yesterday and I just... I just broke down because I was already getting so much backlash and she's so sweet and she told me not so much before or texting me and like... I'm gonna make a video and stuff but I support you, you know, I haven't watched your video because I can't really watch things. I've just checked Twitter and Instagram even though I shouldn't check and just I support you because I've supported you know, I've supported everything. As I support anyone going through anything, you know, and I just lost it. I lost it because I haven't told anyone in my life these feelings. I mean a few people but not a lot because of the judgment of the backlash. It's not something... Patrick start reading me and say like, are you... are you... I think stupid. Just because I put on a wig and nails and makeup, I just... it doesn't mean I'm a girl or woman. I just play dress up and that's fine and I get that. And yes, what I did last week I was playing dress up for a music video is playing dress up for a role. That's not what I was saying is because I did that as a girl. Now I'm a Mia. This is something that I am. That I have just felt since I was... 5, 6, 7. It's something that I've been in therapy. Sorry, my phone. It's a phone call. I have a gender identity therapist that I've been talking to for the past six months because the thing is, is... I never would have said I was transgender before. I never would have said those words because I do have boobs. I do have a vagina so that of course to most people makes me a woman. And I've talked with them and I was like, well, I don't think I'm non-binary. I really am a art. You know, feel male. You told me not every transgender transition. And so much anxiety over this. It's just because of all the things I've done. I'm obviously trolled in the past and I obviously said stuff that I don't mean or I don't stand by. This is something that I've so strongly stand by and I felt like, you know what? I come out with this because I feel like there's a lot of people and maybe there's not a lot but I've got a few TM's from people who said I also struggle with gender identity. And at first, years ago, I have a clip and I'll see if I can find it saying that I wasn't transgender but I wanted to identify as non-binary for me. That was easier to say and easier for people to accept and say, well, I don't identify with any gender but that's not true. I identify as a male, like a two-way, I don't know. It's so hard because I've been through there for the past six months over this. I've been through talking. I talk about this over and over. And it's just because I don't look like a male but I'm just not. People just telling me I'm not transgender and I haven't watched TV's video. But when she called me, she's like, you know, no one can tell you you're not transgender. And I... If you're like, I should apologize because people just stop being nasty to me because this is something that's really... that I really struggled with. As a child, I hated the press. I hated... I hated going into the female bathroom. I hated being classified as female. I hated being told to play with like barbies and stuff like that. I know a lot of people might be like, okay, that's not... that's a tomboy or something. And I don't know how to fully explain. Just like... not hatred but... the utter... like... it's like, I don't know how to describe it other than like, I feel like prisoner in my own body and it kind of always has. I've always kind of changed it up. I've tried to think maybe if I'm more of this way, I'll love my body more. Maybe if I'm this way or maybe if I go ultra feminine, that'll make me feel like a girl. And it just never... it just never happened for me. And I'm sorry if I offend people with my little language and the way I said things. I'm so new to all. I'm so new to it. I just never really talked about it before this year other than like, so with me therapist, I've never... I've never really looked into it. And I know I've just always been attracted to, you know, you're saying like, sexually attractive but like, I've always been drawn to the transgender community in the movie. I guess just my intent, I just loved it. It could just be out in the open people like a plot of them. And I just thought like, as long as I had boobs and stuff like that, that I would never be accepted as transgender. And that's just how it is. I mean, it started early on when I said that I was bisexual and people like, no, you're not. I know maybe I created this for myself that when I used to troll years and years and years ago, people just getting seriously in that. I guess just something I have to do with being as hate having to like hide something because I am so open online and I feel for the past couple of years I've been very honest. I get open and when I do my show, so many people are like, thank you for being open, thank you for being honest. And the more I've heard this, I was like, well maybe I need to be honest about this because it's stuck. And I'm sorry if my confusion on my vocabulary just credits me in any way but I'm not making... I would never, I could never mock a community event. I loved... and it has loved me, has been so open and accepting to me. I would never mock them, I would never do a disservice to myself. Can you imagine? And you imagine? I mean, it's not like, this is not the end of the world dating or whatever, but like, why would I do a disservice to myself? You know, I want to find love and I want to find happiness. Do you know how hard that is to be like that in the video on my channel? So many people criticizing me for a retitle and yes, I could change the title and guess what? I would probably be easier for me too because if I ever date someone in the future, be a guy or a girl and they see I'm transgender, guess what? I hate to say this but a lot of people aren't judgmental and they would... I've had people tell me to my face. I haven't been out with this but I've had people tell me, oh my gosh, like, are you sure you're not actually born a female and stuff like that? Like, it's just the harsh reality and I know it's mean and it's hurtful to hear and it's hurtful for me to hear when people would tell me, like, oh my gosh, like, are you sure you're a woman? Like, there are so many people on Bumble that are trans and don't tell you and stuff. So imagine them looking me up and seeing this. Like, I have to explain it. And I'm okay to explain that but at the same time, maybe my life would just be easier. Let me just take the shell that I've been. Let me just... I look like a female to you. I act like a female to you. Let me just say that I'm a female. And just continue being unhappy. And honestly, that's where I'm at right now. And I'm so sorry if I said anyone but Jesus to say like, are you stupid, you're offensive? And I said, this person at DM back, I said a lot of people DMs back and I'm like, how can you tell me who I am and what I am on the inside? Like, how can you tell me that? You haven't grown up, you haven't been with my struggles mentally. It's just sucks. I did one answer like assumptions yesterday or answering questions of like, what offended you about the video and it just didn't come across the way I wanted to. This is like, I'm going to crossway when she goes no matter how hard I try. There's no way I can sit here and convict you guys. Like, this is who I am and it just, it just sucks. I just don't understand like, I just bought anything. I'm like, you know what? I'll say this and I'll get some porn. I know I'll get a little backlash but I just don't understand how I just don't get how people think I could choose this that I'm just deciding to do. I can't apologize. Like, for who I am and like, how I feel. It sucks that I live in this world and I'm just not allowed to identify as a man because of how I look. Same way people dress up in wings and stuff like that and make up, but they're still a boy. I mean, that's how I feel. I dress up in wings and make up, but I'm still a boy too. It's just so, it's like, it's like, it's PTSD. I'm just like, when I said that I was like bisexual. Because I have, I have come out as, I'll gay before she was lesbian. You know, I thought I was. You know, it's just, I'm so scared. I'm just so scared of everything. I'm just, I'm not talking about the internet, although it's just all crashing down on me, but I'm talking about real life too. And I can't explain it unless you have gone through it as well. I guess I've got a few teams of people who struggle with the same thing, but. Sorry, I'm telling you. I literally have like, just so much excitement. I'm just what I was saying too with like last week, just dressing up in any costume. It felt good to have somewhat of a positive reaction to an outer appearance of how I feel inside. I was so scared for so long to like tell people like, hey, I've been a male since I can remember. And I felt like more comfortable and it was like, it was a way to like ease it out, you know, without even knowing that that's what it would trigger. It's just like a comfortability and a piece with who I am and it is something like I said I've struggled with for so long. I actually have other women tomorrow and so I don't know if I need to talk about a figure it out. And maybe I should figure it out, like I'm just private, I guess I just thought maybe I could help somebody who also deals with the same kind of thoughts I do. And other transgenders who have a transition, you know, maybe there's so many that I've talked with that have a transition or can't afford a transition or don't want a transition. And when you've been in a body for so long, it's... It's like scary, like I said, I've seen the backlash and I've been seeing this because such a public example like Kayla who's like 60 and transition at 60 and getting so much backlash and hate and jokes and stuff. And you know, she makes jokes too, but it's like, you wait 60 years to be the person you want to be and it's like... And I've talked to people who have detransitioned and you know, that also scares me for me personally like, what do I want to do? What do I want to identify as especially because I've been this person for so long on the internet. But I just just know like I... My story, if my truth is it's too... is it meant to like offend anyone? I didn't think it would. I wasn't talking about anyone but myself. And for that, I apologize because that hurts my heart more than me not being able to do myself. It hurts me more that I would hurt other people that have been able to be themselves like... Like every show I go to, I always get questions about LGBT and like all of that. I didn't realize I didn't realize like I had such a support from that community. I guess it just made me feel more open to talk about how deeply I really... Now how much I connect more than just being an ally, being supportive, which I am, but I feel a part of the community without being a part of the community because nobody wants me in it. And I will say, like I said, I haven't watched the video, I don't know what she said in the video, but it will seem so sweet. I just hadn't... a breakdown especially. You know, she called me on the phone and you know... especially the hurt. I've loved GG for so long since we get 8 in. I've never heard of like... Be open and supportive, really, really amazing. I mean she knows me in real life so I get it. And she was one who educated me about being like, you know, there's no such thing as fully transitioned, like being fully transgender, or transgender, no matter what. That's what she said, like no one can tell you and I am that's where... again, I apologize so deeply of my language was like offensive or wrong by saying like fully transitioned, not just like transgender is transgender. Again, I'm not fully educated on it. And but the way she was able to tell me that and like the way she told me to guys support you and she was like, this is what stood out to me. Did I'm receptive of that and I can learn from that but to be like, you're freaking stupid and like... this is not a joke and I'm just a joke because of how I look. I'm just a little female so I'm a joke for me, for identifying as a male. Anyways... It sucks because I feel like I should remember, I think it just went to a part of the chest because it took so long for me to get to this point. I just wasn't expecting so much hate, especially from this community, like loved and like respected and admired and just wanted so badly to be included in all of it. You"
041_Jarvis,"Okay, I'm making this video today for the whole of the Fortnite community and for all of my fans. I generally don't even know how to start this video off. I never thought I'd be having to make this kind of video, but I just have to today. It's obvious the Fortnite has changed my life forever and the amount of people's lives it's changed is just crazy. It's allowed me to pursue my dream and do what I love doing every day. Ever since Fortnite's came out since like two years ago now, I have devoted every hour to become better at the game and just genuinely have fun playing the game. I don't even know how many hours now I've spent creating content on Fortnite for you guys and it's been the best two years of my life. It's genuinely insane how big of an impact this game has had on my life and I wouldn't be here without this game. I'm not even sure what I would be doing right now if Fortnite wasn't a thing. You know, this game has helped me build my platform. It's helped me meet some of the craziest and most awesome people that I've never dreamed of meeting. The amount of lifelong friends and the memories I've had from this game have just been so amazing. It's really crazy. This game has brought so many people from so many different countries together and it just blows my mind that that's even possible. Okay, with that being said, this next part of the video is going to be, it's going to be really tough and I'm not really sure how I have to say this but I just have to say this so that no one makes the same mistake I have done. I'm not sure how many of you know this but I have actually been permanently bound on Fortnite for life. Recently I posted some videos of me using Ambo in soloist and playground mode and just all I was thinking about whilst I was making those videos was just how entertaining and like interesting these videos would be for you guys to watch. It didn't even cross my mind to think that I could be banned for life on Fortnite from those videos. I just want to be clear, this is my first time I've ever done anything like this and of course I have never done this in a competitive game mode at all. Now at the time I posted those videos I was completely oblivious to what could happen to me like what the consequences were. Obviously this was a huge mistake and it's completely wrong on my end. You know I've really done what to be like genuinely I don't even know what I was thinking like cheating and anything is just terrible you should never do it. It's not acceptable. It's zero tolerance you should. It's just it's just such a dumb thing to do. I should have paid more attention to the community rules and the TOS of Fortnite and like I just want to urge you guys all to review all of those terms of services and stuff so that nothing like this could ever happen to you because it's actually so shit. Yeah I generally don't know what to say like this just knowing that I can never play Fortnite again or like... ...cree. Or even like create... ...oh. You know it's crazy that I can never play Fortnite again or even create content for you guys. You know it's obvious that I made a massive mistake and of course I would never think about doing anything like this again. You know when I was making those videos I never thought about the consequences. I never thought about the consequences that could happen from me making those videos. I just thought about entertaining you guys. You know the amount of happiness I get from playing Fortnite every day is crazy like just waking up and being able to play the game is just so much fun. And now I can't play Fortnite at all. I've been playing Fortnite band like you know I know how much you guys all love Fortnite and how much you love watching you play Fortnite. You know it's crazy how one game can generally just change your life forever. And it's just allowed me to become a regular part of your lives where you get home from school or work or whatever and you'll just watch my videos. Like it's truly amazing to me. It also makes you so sad because I just know now that I can never go to any other events or like even be a part of the Fortnite community. Just like the amount of... Obviously this is going to prevent you from going to any other events or even exploring other opportunities and especially meeting you guys at these tournaments. You know it's just so crazy. No I love this game. So much. I'm still going to love this game. So hard. Oh you know I'm still going to love this game. No matter what happens. Like I just wish I could have known how badly I was messing up because I would never have ever thought I'd be even making those kind of videos. I know that this could have actually happened. I know now how big of a estate this was and like I just... There's nothing I can... Epic games you know I know how big of a mistake I've made. I like... I'm truly like so sorry. Epic I know I have to take accountability for my actions and you know I'm gonna... I'm gonna do my best to accept any punishment or like comes my way. Whatever happens. I'm not trying to find like a quick right out but like being banned forever is just... I think in a lifetime ban is... It's... Oh I just didn't... I didn't expect this would happen. Especially from a game you know that I love so much. Like I've never made a video like this and you know I never thought I would have to. Oh I can't speak. You know all I have for one is just like a chance to be able to play for night again. Like that's all I want to do is just play for night. I you know I just want to do what I truly love the most in life and it's just impossible and I have no idea what I'm gonna do next but just know I'm not gonna go anywhere like... Whatever happens I'm gonna carry on making content for you guys of course like I love you guys so much. I appreciate like all the support you guys have shown me here over the last two years like it's just so like just crazy how much love you guys have shown towards me and like... I'm so gets appointed in myself for doing this and not thinking about like the consequences that could have happened. No I just wish I could go back in time and just change all of this to make it never happen. Yeah I'm just like I'm sorry to everybody watching this video. I don't really know what I was to say like I love you he like you guys generally don't understand how much each and every one of you need to meet me. But yeah that's uh that's the end of the video guys this is this is this is it um I'll see you in my next one. I don't I don't I don't know"
042_Hyunee," I would first like to apologize to Stephanie for hurting her in any way and I would also like to apologize to my honey bees for disappointing you guys. I really had no ill intentions. I received a call from Nick. He was crying and he was telling me that he hasn't eaten in six hours and he's been waiting for Stephanie because they had three videos to film that day and he told me she wasn't responding to his texts or calls but Zach told Nick that he had talked to her around three hours before. So Nick really was upset and confused as to why she was avoiding him because they had a great time the other day when they filmed they were laughing, talking about business and talking about everything else and he told me that they had a great time and so he really didn't understand why this was all happening. After six hours Stephanie texted Nick and told him that she was in and out of sleep and so she couldn't text him or call him. And Nick was truly upset because he flew in from Florida and usually when he comes to LA he is really busy. He schedules, collapse back to back to back. To lighten up the mood we kind of made an inside joke saying in and out of sleep and we didn't. It was a lack of judgment but as a friend I wanted to make Nick feel better and just kind of make this whole situation a little bit more light. So that's why we made that inside joke but we made it even bigger by publicizing it and I am truly sorry for doing that and we had no idea that Stephanie at the time was going through mental breakdown and mental trauma and we had no idea that she was sexually assaulted before. And so some things were taken out of context and it made it seem like we were making fun of her mental trauma but we had no idea. I do not condone cyber bullying and because of my actions I don't think it gives an excuse for people to DM me about my dad who is no longer here and telling me to go join my dad and to kill myself and also hurt me to see that my brother was also getting hate and I just think that they had nothing to do with it and I just wish that my family wouldn't be brought into this but I just want to apologize to everyone for disappointing you guys and a lot of people watched my recent crowd video and there's a part where I sing the in and out song but this video was made way before any of this happened. I do have pictures and proof that it was made before any of this happened and I just hope you guys know that I wasn't making fun of this whole situation all over again on my channel or my videos and I just want to say I'm really sorry to Stephanie and anyone else who might have been hurt by this and again I'm so sorry for disappointing you guys but thank you guys for hearing me out."
043_Jay,"What's up guys? So this video is like super hard for me to make. Basically I want to have a heart to heart with you guys about everything that's going on with me in the last like few years. So basically, you know, I've done a lot of stupid things in my life and a lot of stupid things for me. I've got a lot of stupid things for attention on YouTube and it's just I lost so much things recently where I'm just I'm really not proud of who I became. I really lost who I was as a person in pursuit of success or YouTube and I'm just not proud of that anymore. I really I really don't know who I am anymore. And like the title probably says I need to take a break from YouTube. I just need to I just need to stop all social media and I really just need to take some time to figure out who I am. I'm just really sorry for everything I did and over the last couple weeks I've deleted 100 million views off my channel of just like negativity and negativity is just something I don't want to do anymore on YouTube. I don't want to have controversy on YouTube. I don't want to beef with any creators on YouTube. I don't I just want to make YouTube videos regular YouTube videos. I feel like you know when I was younger I just like before I started YouTube I just thought I had so much to prove to the world and like oh yeah everybody doubted me that I could become something on YouTube and guess what I did it but at the end of the day I lost everything that's important to me and including like I lost who I was as a person. I just really became over these last few years just somebody I'm not proud to say I am I've developed like stuff about me that I just it really discussed me. I don't know how long I'm going to take a break for. Could be a week could be a month could be a year. I don't know just I just need to do some things in my private life that are really going to you know bring me back down to earth I really need to check my ego. I'm just really disappointing to myself you know. And what I would do for attention you know it's just really sick and for anybody who was upset about what I did I just want to tell you I want to tell you straight up I'm sorry for how I made you feel. You have my word I'll never do anything like that again and I'm really taking some time to look into like what would make me do such horrible things. You know using dead people or people who passed away for attention like using someone's tragedy for an opportunity is this. It's just disgusting. It really makes me sick you know that happened a long time ago I did that I think a year and a half ago but what just makes me really upset about it is that I have so much of an influence because of so many subscribers or people subscribe to me that I have these other smaller channels that are doing the same thing. I feel responsible for attention like I feel responsible for that. These people saw what I did and they're doing it and I just want to let you know if you're one of those people that are calling this person who just passed away. Man that is insensitive, immature, stupid everybody's going to hate you for that and just imagine if it was your own mother or somebody close to you that passed away. Somebody doing this pretending that they're still alive calling them at 3 a.m. No. It's just not something I'm proud of of doing ever and for the longest time I had these videos just still up on my channel. I... I don't know. I just... I need some time to think about everything I did. During this whole process of doing YouTube I really sacrifice everything in order to get where I'm at, everything and it... Like for example, I haven't talked to my dad for 4 years straight. This whole time I was doing YouTube, haven't talked to my dad, haven't talked to my sister. The last time I talked to my sister was like... ...close to when I began YouTube, a little after I began YouTube. My mother barely talked to her, barely at all. I just found out she's on chemotherapy and I don't even reach out to her to see how she's doing. I'm just so focused on YouTube views, attention that I neglect the people that are closest to me and it's just like... I just... Man... I really just lost who I was and I'm... God forbid, like one of these people that's close to me pass away on my pursuit right now while I ignore them. If they passed away I wouldn't be able to live with myself. It's you two more important than... ...your loved ones. I just lost like someone I cared deeply about just recently doing a YouTube stunt and... I treated her awful, awful, you know, like... Her grandma passed away and instead of like... ...supporting her, comforting her, my girlfriend... ...I said suck it up. We gotta keep grinding, we gotta keep going. What's more important? Success? Or your grandma, she's already gone. Like how heartless could I get? I just... I got so freaking heartless over the years and... ...after all that all this stuff that went down recently... ...it's just been eating me up and... ...I just hate who I become and I'm really doing my best to change that and to become a better person. But I'm just gonna need some time away from YouTube and social media to like really figure out. Like get myself in check. Because I love you guys if you've been supporting me or are fan of me. I love you guys. I make all the YouTube videos for you guys. I'll never forget about you. I will be back. But I hope you guys can understand like... ...I messed up too many times and... ...I gotta change and I gotta change for myself. I gotta change for my family, people who are close to me. I gotta change for you guys. The worst thing about this is... ...not only did I put myself... ...in danger from... ...these stunts. Like... ...thank you for YouTube. They didn't delete my channel but they could have. So... ...I'm thankful that they didn't. But... ...not only did I put my own self in danger. I could have put all the other creators in a danger too. What if there was an ad apocalypse? All because of me. I'd affect so many people just because I'm reckless. Just because I want attention that bad. I could make a regular video... ...and still get views. I just don't know what is wrong with me. I don't know what's wrong with me. I need to get some help. I need to take a break from YouTube. Anybody that I've ever heard, any creator that I've ever had beef with... ...I am sorry. I am sorry. It's been eating me up. Trust me. If we've ever had some back and forth... ...I've been thinking about it. I've been thinking about... ...how stupid I was. And... ...I hope one day you could forgive me. If you can't, I totally understand. I'm just gonna try my best to become the best person I can be. I'm still gonna delete more videos on my channel. There's some videos that I'm really not proud of. Still, I haven't gone through them all. But so far, I deleted the XXX video. Some... ...due to the video. The XXX video. Some... ...videos I did with drinking a gay potion. I really don't like that. Really, really don't like that. I don't have any problem with gay people. It's just... ...it could be pretty insensitive. Like, I did a lot of stereotypical stuff that... ...I'm just not proud of... ... ...eat... Over the next couple days, you're gonna see... ...I'm gonna delete a ton of these videos. Anybody... ...any time I had beef with another creator, I deleted it. Or I'm about to delete it. And again, I just wanna say, sorry. I love you if you've been supporting me. There's just been too many people who... ...who mean everything to me that I've hurt in this process. And... ...I just need to get my life on track. So... ...I started working out. I started posting way less and just trying to focus on becoming better. I deleted all those videos. I reached out to my mom. I told my mom I love her... ...for the first time in like 10 years. I haven't told my mom I love you in 10 years. I reached out to her and told her that... ...I just wanna fix a bunch of broken relationships. And I wanna get some people back in my life that... ...are really important to me. So again, I saw her for anybody. I did wrong ever. I'm gonna try my best to make it right. So... ...anyways... ...love you guys so much. Thank you for rockin' with me and understanding this. I'll be back. Not sure when, but I'll be back. Love you guys so much. Peace."
044_NikiDe,"So I uploaded a video yesterday that I had already pre-filmed which was me telling you guys how to help with your mental health during this social distancing time. And I did leave a brief apology in the beginning of the video because I felt weird to upload a video that didn't have to do with all the accusations and drama going on. I want to apologize and say I'm sorry for everything that's gone down. Thank you for calling me out. And I'm sorry if I made anyone feel singled out or made fun of. I think what hurts me underneath all this is that people were hurt by it. I can't be ignorant with the platform I have. And I felt like there was things I needed to address so I did the best I could. But after thinking about it over a few days I realized I really do owe you guys a full-on video and here it is. I've been on TikTok. I'm a new TikTok user. Follower I think it's freaking hilarious. I follow the TikToks that are more comedy based. Not really so much the cutesy stuff. But it's just an addicting app and for someone like me who's been like really really really anxious or anyone that's anxious watching this. You guys know that it's good to sometimes laugh at the darkness. And I know that sounds weird to people that don't do that but the people that do do that. I know you'll understand what I mean. There's this trend on TikTok called it's corona time. It's corona time. It's corona time. I'll admit I've been guilty of laughing and favoriting some of the corona time TikToks. What the trend is is that people are using this song called it's corona time. And they're doing everyday things but with a corona twist on it. Like wearing a mask or like hoarding a bunch of toilet paper or water bottles. It's corona time. Hey it's corona time right now. It's corona time. Now that you know the trend if you didn't know the trend. My one friend reached out to me and asked to get our nails done together. I said yeah because I was gonna trust my gut and feel it out when I got there. If it seemed crowded or like I don't know. Like if my gut felt like it was wrong I would trust my gut to say no I can't fall through it this and go home. This drama's been going on for almost a week. Please look at the time period here. I would never go get my nails done right now because things obviously have gotten worse. And I'm social distancing as is everyone else. Here's an example of social distancing. If you guys don't know what that is you guys should be staying inside right now. And here's why social distancing is the only thing in our control that we can do to stop this pandemic and to have this end sooner than it's lasting. We actually went to a nail salon that was packed. We went to another one and we found an empty one and I felt safe going to this one because it was empty. We walked in there and the woman was wearing a mask and I got the idea. Oh my gosh like they have masks at nail slons. Can we borrow masks? You know we're just all being safe and me being addicted to TikTok thought oh my gosh this is such a TikTok. We're all matching the nail lady like normally like the nail salon workers wear the mask and we just sit there. But we had masks and we were all wearing masks and I thought it would have this like we're all in this together vibe. So we put on the masks and I filmed us getting our nails done with the mask to the song. It's corona time. I do also want to let you guys know I would have done that video regardless who was doing my nails. I see everyone equally so I truly didn't see the problem till someone texted me. Here's some other videos that never made it to my Instagram story or TikTok. I was planning on just getting content while getting my nails done. So this is literally all I was gathering and it wasn't just the worker. Okay, like it literally wasn't me filming just to say hey she gave me corona. And I didn't think anything of it until people started reaching out to me. So this is the first text exchange after I posted my story where someone that knows me reached out to me and was really blunt and told me to take down the story for the reasons they mentioned. They said I shouldn't be out in public but you know what everyone else is saying. And I took down the story and right away I thought oh my gosh like I knew I shouldn't have went out in public. Then I went to Twitter and I saw all my ads and I saw that people were calling me racist and xenophobic. And that's where I was like oh. So like at first I thought people were mad at me for being in public and I was like shit I knew I shouldn't have gone in public. Then I was informed about xenophobia. I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right. I'm sorry if I'm not. I understand how it looked that way. And I'm not making this video to be like I did nothing wrong I did nothing wrong because I'm taking accountability. If I'm gonna have this platform I need to understand the position I'm in and I can't be so thoughtless and impulsive and dumb when doing something for humor. I feel like you know I'm 24 I'm a grown-ass woman. This is something that an 18 year old shouldn't even do. And for that I'm sorry and I'm truly sorry if I've offended anyone that has followed me or anyone that has seen that video that doesn't follow me and that's what they know me for. You guys if you know what you guys don't know me in person and what what I put out there is what you judge me based off of. So I can't play the feel bad for me card and I'm not going to because I did this to myself. I didn't think before I posted. I'll apologize for my mistake but I'm not racist and I know who I am and it is what it is. I'll see you guys hopefully another video. Stay safe stay healthy wash your hands stay inside. Bye guys."
045_Kate,"Hey guys, I'm sorry this took so long to come out. I was processing things and thinking things through and this is my first time going through something like this and I wanted to go about it as best as I possibly could. I want to be honest. My relationship with Carson was very complicated. I had a boyfriend at the time and neither Carson nor my boyfriend at the time knew about each other. And while I was clear with Carson that Carson and I were not in a relationship, I still let him on and ended up hurting Carson and my boyfriend at the time very badly in the process. I am now seeing a therapist and although I didn't realize it at the time, I was dealing a lot with depersonalization and I felt like I was two different people living two different lives. I felt like a passenger in my own body. I ignored very conflicting feelings and thoughts and I was very lost and confused and I didn't know what I wanted or what was important to me. And this was when I got involved with it and I handled it very similarly to how I handled previous things. I depersonalized a lot and was very lost and confused and didn't know what I wanted and made a lot of bad decisions because of that. And I hurt both him and Carson and their friendship as well. And Carson and I streamed together and his community very much saw us as a couple which we encouraged and it felt really good to have such a positive impact on so many people and I'm sorry to all those people that I let down disappointed. There are so many things I could have done better and I was lost and confused and I ended up hurting people that I cared about and in the future, I want to be better and I want to focus on myself which is why I'm taking further time off streaming and I'm working through my depersonalization. I'm still seeing my therapist and I want to live my life more openly and honestly and more than anything I want to be honest with myself which is something that I've struggled with a lot. And I'm sorry to everyone. I'm sorry to I'm sorry to my community and anyone that I've disappointed or let down. I'm sorry to Carson's community. I'm sorry to Fitz's community and anyone else's community who is affected by this anyone who had a deal with this drama in their chat. I'm sorry to Tempo. I'm sorry to Fitz for hurting his image and his friendship with Carson. I'm sorry to my ex-boyfriend for handling our relationships so poorly. He's very much a victim in this and Carson who was also a victim in this and deserved a lot better. I don't expect anyone to forgive me but I hope that this at least can provide some understanding."
046_SomeO,Hello guys and gals me Moodahar and I own apology 100% now ladies and gentlemen I sorry for the off the cuff video quality out there. It's just it's an apology that I have to pretty much get out 100% Because I kind of want to make this video before sort of like any other you know hundred like mini channels pick this shit up and covered it because the reality of it is I do own apology and the last thing I want to see is people fight from you when I'm clearly in the wrong now I made two videos one of them was the hypocrisy reason climb and I made another video where I followed up retracting a wrong point that I made now I donation shame Jeff Bezos or not I donation shame I claimed Ethan Klein had donation shame Jeff Bezos for a hundred million dollars which was a complete fallacy wrong I made that video sort of in kind of like you know anger of being like a former fan uploaded it and I made a wrong statement and for that I 100% Oh Ethan a complete apology for that video it was wrong and I should have checked my sources better for sure 100% Now that being said a lot of people have sent me like one clip in particular which if it can load up real quick I don't know if the audio works or it does it looks like it's working But a lot of people sending me this clip where he was like in the middle of like the Australian like wildfires and he donation shame Jeff Bezos which is kind of The fuck they sent me this like it They sent me this clip listen to it yeah yeah yeah you're gonna donate that little he makes that in six minutes love it love it that's incredible The thing is I have lots of rocket ships I need to shoot off so it's a bit you move when you're like a I was wondering what's with the word number so it's a million So yeah that's pretty much where it ends I definitely recommend you watch more because I'm gonna add like an other couple lecture seconds of context but Ethan actually wasn't really donation shaming Jeff Bezos over there kind of like I think more asking a question but you know being the internet and what it is a lot of people quickly make a speculation which coincidentally something that I fucking did and I was wrong so you know it's time to call out what it is what what's worth being called out you know one of the things I've learned is if you're wrong you got to own up to your shit you got to call it a day now there were a couple things in the response video that I watched that kind of made me go a little bit that he said that I'm worth it I'm worth like two million it's actually like forty five million because if we're gonna use one of those network sites we got we got to pick the one that has a highest number that's what's going to put me in like the more like a good a flexi right but anyways all jokes on side from all of that I was ultimately wrong and you know it's something that I definitely own up to and I apologize to Ethan 100% for that you know I feel like when you're in the wrong you're in the wrong and when I see people try to defend me over something that I was wrong about I think that's like the dumbest thing ever because if I'm wrong you know I'm not gonna send what I'm going to send you a you know his response video he pointed out a flock in my argument a pretty big flop and for that I owe an apology now I don't want to really get into the whole like hey it's it's slanted or any kind of deal because people have been making conspiracy theories up about this all night saying that Ethan sending like a fucking you know assassin or legal team after me to like kill me or like you know throw me down which hasn't happened I remove both of those videos because I was wrong 100% you know watching that response video I was wrong for sure and that is what it is and I don't know if Ethan's gonna watch this video or not probably not I'm not sure but the reality of it is yeah I'm sorry bro I fucked up pretty well and you know the apology that you deserve I'm here to give it to you full full full force with that said I also an apology to you the viewer because I didn't notice my ego coming out in the last two videos and I think Ethan's response video definitely pointed it out and a lot of the comments even pointed it out too and you know the last thing I want to do is like come across some egotistical like fucking big brain I'm on the on the smartest dude in the room because in reality I'm just some fucking cringy little dumbass on the internet and I've said this since the beginning of my career and I've probably say this to like till I'm done with all of this is that I just want to be the same like stupid little Indian humble kid in the in the computer because in reality that's something that I am I see that aspect of me come out and during those videos and while yes I was playing up for the audience and a bit of the jokes I think the ego definitely showed and I apologize for the ego showing because that's not me and I don't want that to me me and if if that came across to the fans you know the same way that it came across me I owe you an apology whether you're a fan of me or not it's just not a cool thing to do with all of that said though you know I definitely don't like seeing people try to defend me in this situation when I'm in the wrong and so I'm making this video because I think the last person that should have any response is is me and I feel like I feel like the best response is to own up to my shit and to tell you guys that I fucked up and to make a proper apology and going forward I'm definitely got to vet my videos a billion times better it made me learn something this channel is a lot bigger than it ever was and you know maybe I could like lose my shit go off the cuffs years ago but I mean I was I was blaming Ethan for the same stuff and I guess I made a shitty take when I claimed he made a shitty take so at the end of the day there's got to be a lot of self learning on my end as well and going forward realizing how big my channel actually is I have responsibility to not make shitty claims and with that said I give my whole apologies to Ethan and and he look for sure I feel like they both deserve it hardcore you said something about me doxing you I use publicly available information but again you know I definitely definitely do side with the fact that if this could cause you any harm at your house I definitely don't want that happening I know how bad it is to have personal information leaked and things like that I never intended for that to happen I figured because every other site covered it and you know other youtubers covered it that it was kind of fair game but I definitely admit you know it could cause some undue complications I would say with all that said though you know I think one of the things always notice on YouTube is like this whole back and forth bickering and in this case when I'm in the wrong man I mean the fucking wrong like it is what it is you know I can't fucking I can't fucking go back and forth knowing that I shot myself in the fucking foot to begin with with that I definitely grabbed fucked up you know this is coming from like a former fan and you know at the end of the day I wish Ethan included these in my clips but I don't really hate you bro and I know you may not watch this video whatever but I hope the best it's just like you know when you have that mentality of like a former fan sometimes it clouds you and you you make a really shitty take and you call it a day but with that said though you know I'm just gonna drop it where it's at you know and I kind of highly advise that people you know from my side I've seen like a lot of people on this common section is trying to defend me and like call them like you know like just just straight like get toxic which I don't really approve of there's no reason for anybody to get toxic especially like people from my call it a day you know Ethan's Ethan's got us podcast I've got deep web browsing with that said though maybe today or tomorrow deep web browsing I'm not sure but ladies and gentlemen this is me Moodahar and um out
047_Colleen,"Hey guys, I know this is not my typical video that you are used to seeing, but recently some things have come up that I feel like I need to address. And so I just wanted to sit down and have an honest conversation with you and address everything at once. So let's get started. The first thing I want to talk about is something that is weighing the heaviest on my heart right now. The video has resurfaced of my sister and I from 14 years ago. We are teenagers and in this video we are doing characters that are Latina. And the characters are completely based on racial stereotypes. It is not funny and it is completely hurtful. I am so ashamed and embarrassed that I ever thought this was okay. I was a sheltered teenager who was stupid and ignorant and clearly extremely culturally insensitive. Racial stereotypes are not funny. They are not a joke and they should never be joked about. A few years later we realized how stupid and hurtful the video was and we deleted it. Not out of fear of getting caught but out of fear that someone would find it and it would hurt them because it's wrong. I have grown and learned so much from my ignorant mistakes as a teenager and I've done everything I can to write my wrongs. Now this video was brought to light right after I had posted a video on my vlog channel last week with my friend Todrick talking about racism and how it is still very much a problem in our world today and how we need to fight against it. People were saying how dare I talk about racism when I said these things 14 years ago and to you I say that is the exact reason why I should be talking about racism and why I should be standing up against it because I was one of the dumb ones who said that stupid thing and grew from it and learned from it and realized how hurtful it could be and now I want to write my wrongs and make a difference so that other people don't make the same mistakes that I made when I was a kid. Another video popped up recently that I want to address and it's a video that I filmed 12 years ago where I talk about taking a flight and an overweight woman sat next to me and I talk really negatively about her and it's awful. And I watched this clip and I was appalled and shocked that those things were coming out of my mouth 12 years ago because that is not the woman who I am today. I'm such a huge advocate for women and women's bodies and loving every shape and every size and the fact that I talked negatively about someone who was overweight is absolutely disgusting to me. Something else I want to talk about that has been brought up is that when I was three years old I was bit by a dog, I needed to go to the hospital and when my mom told the doctor that a dog had bit me, the doctor said that legally the dog need to be put down. Now the clip of me that is circulating from seven years ago is me talking about this situation in a very insensitive way. When in reality when our dog was put down I was really upset and over the years I have addressed this a few times in videos talking about how guilty I feel, how upset I am that this happened. Still to this day is a 33 year old woman, I feel guilty that our dog had to be put down for biting me. But in this clip I talk about the story in a very dramatic silly way because sometimes unfortunately I use humor to talk about things that are actually extremely painful for me and this is an example of that. To anyone and everyone who is hurt or offended by the statements I made when I was younger I am so so sorry. I hope you all can see that the person who I am today is so far from that ignorant person I was over a decade ago. And to those of you who might say well I knew better when I was that age or 14 years ago I knew right from wrong I'm so glad that you did because that means that there's one less person making those stupid mistakes that I made. I should have known better and I didn't and I'm extremely embarrassed by that. I'm really hopeful that I can be used as proof that people can change and grow and learn from their mistakes. If you continue to speak up when you see someone doing something or saying something wrong it can make a difference. As I grew up I learned that those words were hurtful and I stopped using them but there are still people in our world currently who are saying racist homophobic, sexist, body shaming things that need to stop. They need to be called out because they can change I'm living proof of it and my ignorant words from my past just make me that much more passionate to help the people that my words might have hurt. These things are being brought to light because some people are upset with me for not addressing something that happened a few weeks ago. Someone had made a video saying some shocking and hurtful things about me and a lot of you wanted me to address it and I didn't. I didn't address it not because I was just ignoring it and hoping it would go away but because when this person messaged me letting me know they were upset I responded immediately. I was very shocked and confused I expressed I didn't know what they were talking about and I also expressed frustration that they were trying to bring my son's name into their drama. Then I received a message from this person's mother asking me to not speak his name so I was trying to respect the mother's wishes and the parents' wishes of this 17 year old. But it has gotten to a point where there are so many rumors and lies and speculations going around I feel like I need to address it. I do have receipts proving the things that I'm about to tell you however I feel uncomfortable sharing them because he is a minor. So I'm only going to be showing you the things that were between adults or things that were already public. The biggest issue that came from his video is that I sent a child underwear and wow anyone who heard this out of context and was offended I completely understand because I would be too. But in this situation context is everything so I would like to give you some context to this situation. Four years ago I did a livestream and in this livestream I did a giveaway. I was giving away clothes that were unused, tags still on brand new that I had just bought that I did not want. One of the items that was in this box was a really ugly pair of underwear. As soon as we pulled them out for me and I started laughing and joking around about how ugly they were, why did I buy these ridiculous underwear? It was so stupid. I just got big old box from Forever 21 and I want to open it up in front of you guys. Maybe I'll send the ones I don't want to you guys. I got a bunch of crop tops. Oh god! The panties. The panties from... And people started asking for them in the livestream. Who wants that brawl? You want the brawl? Everyone wants the brawl. The end of the livestream I was done giving away clothes and then this boy who made this video about me recently, he asked for the underwear. Yeah, he picked people. I think that's enough. Did that boy win these or not? I don't know. He has to tell me what he wants. What do you say? He said, um, hi, you have ugly clothes but I want those ratchet panties and bra sign by corb because he modeled them well. Yeah! It was so ridiculous and funny we laughed about it and I forgot to send them to him. And eventually he tweeted me asking me for them again. I sent them to him. He put them on over his clothes and posted about them. It was like a big joke within the fandom. I did this publicly. That livestream is still up right now. And I've always given out weird random things in livestreams. I've given out a taco costume. I've given out old bobby pins, dirty shoes. A few weeks ago I sent a fan like a single piece of toilet paper. I've always given away weird stuff. And so in my mind at the time, this was no different than all the other weird stuff I send to my fans as a joke. Now in hindsight, I see how completely stupid of me. I should have never sent that. I don't know what part of my brain was missing at the time that I thought, oh, this is a normal silly thing to do. I should have realized and recognized how dumb that was and never sent it to him, no matter how much he asked. But it was never a sneaky, creepy, gross thing that I was doing in secret. It was a silly, stupid mistake that now is being blown way out of proportion. He also mentioned in his video that his mom was uncomfortable with me, which was surprising and shocking for me to hear because I was always under the impression due to the things he told me and the things that I saw on the internet that she not only was aware of our interactions, but she was very supportive of him being a fan of mine. She commented on a photo of him this year at my show, saying how it was such a fun night. She even my birthday card when he was 16 with me on it. And he let me know multiple times how much his parents loved me and watched my videos. So this was surprising for me to hear because if I had known that I would have stopped all interactions with him if I ever knew his parents were uncomfortable. Another thing I think is important to address from his video is that he did have access to my Miranda Singh's Twitter account for one day, not for years. And I want to just go over how that whole situation went down. Over the years, I've loved asking my fans for advice on what I should post for Miranda videos, Miranda tweets, things like that. Quite honestly, you guys are the funniest people that I know and I love your advice, I love your input. I've taken a handful of suggestions as to what I should tweet as Miranda from my fans over the years and he is included in that. I used a couple of his tweet ideas many years ago. They did really well, he was super funny. And since then, he's asked me multiple times if he can help me out with social media again. I always thought that was really, really sweet. But most of the time, I did not engage in those conversations until recently. A couple of months ago, he reached out to me and brought up the fact that the Miranda accounts hadn't been as active as they used to be and how he wanted to help me do more social media stuff. So he sent me a whole bunch of edited photos that he had in a folder, ready to go for Miranda. He told me about a bunch of funny tweets he wanted to post and he let me know that he had experience working in social media. He really vetted for himself and because I had known him for so many years, I was over exhausted and I don't have all the time I used to have to run all my social media. I thought, you know what, this might be a good situation to test run this and see if this could work out. This wouldn't be the first time I had hired a fan. I love hiring my fans for many reasons. One, they're super freaking talented. Two, they know me better than anybody. And three, I love supporting their dreams and passions in any way that I can. I've hired my fans to design merch. I've hired fans to go on tour with me. I've hired fans to edit things for me. And how hiring my employees works is I usually do a little test run to see how it goes. If it goes well, then I hire them officially through my company and they are paid legally through the corporation. It was no different for him. I wanted to do a little test run. If it went well, then I wanted to hire him. So I gave him access to my account and he started tweeting stuff for me. And pretty quickly, there was a tweet that was posted that was problematic. This was my fault. He sent me a very long list of a ton of different things he wanted to post. And I did not look over it closely enough. I did not review it closely enough. I remember the moment when I saw all these things. I was breastfeeding my son and I kind of just scrolled through and was like, yeah, go for it. Have fun. I trust you. And when he posted it, I put zero blame on him at all. It was my fault. I knew better than to let someone else tweet for me. I should have reviewed closely every single thing that was going to come out of Miranda's mouth. I let him know that I loved him. He did a great job. It was my fault, not his. I publicly apologized for the tweet. I deleted the tweets that were posted that weren't posted from me. I let him know that I was upset that people were disappointed in me. And then he said he logged out of the account. And that was the end of it. That was the last I heard from him until he sent me the message saying he was really upset with me. And that is when I then responded and got the message from his mom. I care about him so much, just like I care about all my fans that I've interacted with over the years. And I wish him nothing but success and happiness and love. I don't know what he's going through right now, but I don't want him to hurt anymore. He made it very clear in his video that he wants to move on from this and be separated from this whole situation. So let him have that and let me have the same. It absolutely breaks my heart to see people saying negative things about me interacting with my fans based on this situation. I love talking to my fans. I love interacting with my fans. My fans are many different ages. So yes, there are some teenagers, but there's also adults. I love supporting them, supporting their passions, learning about them, and the same way that you like to do that for me. To me, you aren't just my fans. You're my friends. We all have seen me cry way too many times on this channel about things. I probably should have kept to myself. I definitely overshare. And I have definitely overshared with fans when they have asked me what's wrong or asked me how I'm feeling or try to console me when I'm feeling down. I definitely have overshared in the past with them and talked with them a little too much when I should have kept things to myself or talked to family or close friends instead. There are plenty of other stupid mistakes I've made in my past that I've learned from and grown from. There are plenty of other jokes I've made in my career that seem to appropriate at the time, but now I realize we're never appropriate to begin with. I've learned from these things and I will continue to learn from them and grow from them to become the best me that I can possibly be. I've lived my life on the internet for you guys all to watch for over 12 years. I love my job. But one of the difficult parts of my job is that I am very much put underneath a microscope and any and all mistakes I ever make are definitely shown and blasted to thousands and sometimes millions of people all over the world. That's not an easy thing to deal with. However, I'm really grateful for that. Over the past 12 years, you guys have been really wonderful helping me learn and grow to be a better person. You've given me helpful critiques, educated me when I was ignorant, told me how to say things more appropriately. And I can't even tell you how grateful I am for that because of you, I have become a better person. The person I am today as a 33 year old mother is not the person I was when I started YouTube so many years ago. But over the last month, I've received a lot of criticism that isn't the type of constructive criticism I've received over the last decade. It is more just hateful and cruel and the things that are being said about me are absolutely horrendous. No, I should have never sent a fan underwear how stupid am I. No, I definitely should have never given him access to my Twitter account. And no, I shouldn't have talked to him as often as I did. But I am not a monster, I am not a groomer, and I shouldn't kill myself. Be careful with the words you choose to use because I have learned time and time again that words definitely matter and your words can hurt people and they can affect people in a very negative way. And I just hope that that's a lesson we can all learn in this situation. I never meant to cause anyone who feels affected by this any pain. We're in the middle of a global pandemic and it is scary. And I just want to say I'm so sorry if this situation made any of you feel more stressed or uncomfortable or sad than you already do because of all the horrible things that are currently going on in our world. I love you guys. Thank you so much for taking the time to watch this and I will see you very soon."
048_Stauff,"This is by far the hardest video James and I have ever publicly had to make but before I get into the video I did just want to say thank you to how amazing our viewers have been. We have some viewers who have been just like so incredibly kind and respectful of our son's privacy. I just want to say thank you like that. I really got me through some really hard times and I just want to say thank you. If you have no idea what that means to me and some special messages that you sent like just thank you for the good stuff. I can't say enough how hard my dad has tried throughout his entire journey and the amount of effort she's put into this and helping her as much as she can. So I mean you guys have been part of this adoption journey even before we could have actually throughout the whole process and you know with international adoption sometimes there's unknowns and things that are not transparent on files and things like that and once actually came home there's a lot more special needs that we weren't aware of and that we were not told. So over the past few years Huxley's been in numerous therapies to try to help with all of his needs and over the last year has been a more intense therapy that he's been in to try to help him as much as possible with his severe needs and for us it's been really hard hearing from the medical professionals a lot of their feedback and things that have been really upsetting for us because it's not what we've ever wanted to hear we've ever wanted to be in this position and we've been trying to get his needs that and help him as much as possible to the office. Can we truly love him? There's not an ounce of our bodies it doesn't lock up things on our beam there wasn't a unit that I didn't try our hardest and I think what James trying to say is that after multiple assessments after multiple evaluations numerous medical professionals have felt that he needed a different fit and his medical needs he needed more. We haven't made this video yet and it's because we've been trying to protect his privacy, his rights and also just try to not mess up his future that was laid out in front of us. We're trying our best to make sure we don't impact that at all and make a video and then... That's why I went on Instagram and stuff that I've had to let you know as little as I could but I couldn't tell you anymore because you don't want to mess anything up. I wonder what's going on legally and if I said something was I going to mess up things for his future. It's just been a really hard place to be in because you're grieving, I don't want to share with you guys. I know he's gone inside that I don't have to say anything like I don't have to say this, I don't have to say what I want to. I want to tell you guys have been there for us for so much and I want to fill you in on what's going on and what's hard. Do I feel like I'm failure as a mom like 500% so when you get in city as hurtful comments it just really makes our heart worse. It's not about me at all but it's just like this journey has been the last couple months and it's been the hardest thing I could ever imagine going to choosing to do. Because ultimately after pouring our hearts into this little hole. The reason why we can't go into the detail of what actually transpired is because we're truly going to protect our police privacy and not let people know what happened to what everything that went on to make us make this decision or to even call them to medical professionals with the need to get more help. Anything that happened in the home that was hard for Huck, that's not fair for me to put out there publicly that's his privacy. So we're not going to talk about that, that's not appropriate. And that will never be appropriate. I didn't adopt a little boy too. Share these things publicly. Every now and then you may have gotten like a tiny struggle or like a hardship when I was trying to be like really raw and real. But we haven't intentionally, like day one intentionally, 99% of the struggles we have never publicly aired ever. With pure intent of respecting his privacy, not to give you a fake facade or to be lack of transparency but to respect our son's privacy. And this is all that we're okay with sharing. The reason we haven't updated you sooner is because the medical professionals, the agencies, multiple people, have been allowing for Huck's to spend time with some different people to see and to make the perfect match and fit for his now new forever family. From the updates we've gotten from the agency and through the adoption agency, they were able to place him in what they thought was literally the perfect match. When we met Jimmy's and early, when we got Huck's, we didn't know a lot of these unknowns. And when agencies or adoption agencies have more pieces to the pie or they have more pieces, it makes the matching process a little better. Or a healthier match. And they found somebody that they thought would be ultimately the best fit and he is thriving. He is very happy, he is doing really well and his new mommy has medical, professional training and is a very good fit. And I ask everyone that watching this video that supports our family, give us grace, give us the support and the privacy that we need during this time for ourselves and for actually... Please just respect his privacy. I just know that we may call on socials like when I, for my channel, the reason I started my channel is to be positive and to bring people positivity. Even though we are struggling and that when we talk about us, it's a huge one for us. Just because I may be positive on my story, if I have fun, doing some fun, doesn't mean that I am not still horribly hurting in the same fruit. Jim, please have grace with us because even though we don't share that publicly, we are still struggling. I mean we are going to be hard-broken for a very long time. Thank you for everything and we just really appreciate all of your support and kindness. I just, please respect our privacy."
049_Linus,"I was recently involved in some drama with Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, best known for titles like Adventure Math and Zargon, but you also might have heard of one of their more recent projects. Those guys. The easiest thing for me to do at this point would be to roughly add up how many people are mad at me for slinging a false accusation based on my own arrogance and ignorance, conclude that it's probably not worth the PR damage of drawing any further attention to this and move on. But if I'm interpreting this response correctly, and I think I am, I have just been taken to school. So, Mr. Sweeney, I have no idea if you'll watch this, but the only action left for me right now is to issue my apology in full view of the million or millions of people who watch this video and show you that even though I was careless and disrespectful, I do still know how to do my homework and correct misconceptions about technology, even if in this case I was the one who spread them. So here we go. The worst part of making this video is already over, fortunately, but it was going back and watching Past Linus' performance on the Wandshow after a week where he clearly hadn't found the time to watch the excellent look into the PlayStation 5's development and hardware by Mark Surney. But then ran his mouth anyway. Why does someone like Tim Sweeney? How many billions of dollars is he worth? Why does he need to say stuff that's just like demonstrably false? This is an SSD that is not only as fast as the PlayStation 5's SSD, but is actually 15,000 megabytes a second double the speed. Why do you need to sell out to Sony to just say stuff that's just not true at all? My second mistake was relying on second-hand information about what? Mr. Sweeney said about the SSD in the first place. I'm an experienced enough social media user that I should have known that the jousting back and forth between fanboys of either console or PC would contain half-truths and misquotes. He never said, fastest, which is open to interpretation. He said, best in class. My final mistake by far the worst one was slinging a personal attack. I honestly doubt that he cares that I called the thing he never said a stupid thing to say. He said it. It's probably a little bit like 640k of RAM should be enough for anybody. That quote Bill Gates has denied ever saying. It's annoying, but it's not worth losing sleep over. No of the real problem is that I got caught up doing a bit boasting about how much SSD could beat up your SSD that was frankly speaking, mostly intended to mock fanboy behavior in general, but ended up coming off as though I was speaking completely interested. And during it, I suggested that he was being paraded out to misrepresent the PS5 technology for money or some other kind of game. And this is all based on a quote he never said. What the hell was I thinking? I know from personal experience how much it hurts to be called a shill or a sellout when all you were doing was giving your honest take. And amplifying this insult was the PC fanboys who bothered him on Twitter talking about how you know, sucks or the PS5's SSD. SSD, SSD, SSD is a product that by the way isn't even available yet, so we can't know for sure is compared to PC Master racer, whatever malarkey. So for those of you who participated in that, if you're watching this, you can go ahead and blame it on me, but please send your own separate apology to AttymSweeneyEpic after you've finished watching this video to fill in the gaps in your own knowledge about the PS5's storage. As we've discussed on this channel before, one of the main reasons we don't do SSD reviews is that we know enough to know that we don't know enough about them. The reason that Ross sequential bandwidth gets bandied about so much in marketing materials is only because it's easily digestible. You'd number good, small number bad. But in a PC, or current Gen console for that matter, the presence and capacity of the DRAM cache, the features and performance of the controller on the drive, the type of NAND flash and use, clever use of high speed SLC caching on slower, multi-bit per cell end. Any of those one things could affect real world performance more meaningfully than ideal conditions sequential read and write specs. And there's a major factor that I've mostly ignored over the years because I just didn't think about it. As a PC gamer, I'm basically stuck with whatever Microsoft will give me. And that's the effects of software and how the device can interact with the rest of my hardware. Because that is what Mr. Sweeney was talking about. That's why he said best in class, not fastest. And he's obviously not wrong about this. We even showed recently that on a fast gaming PC, upgrading from a SATA SSD all the way to a state of the art PCI express Gen 4 SSD, a theoretical increase in performance of over 5X would not affect your experience as a PC gamer. Because you run up against some of the problems that Sony set out to solve here. First is the inaccessibility of data. The conventional wisdom is that storage does not improve the image quality settings that you can use or the FPS that your game will run at. And that's because conventional game design assumes that any asset the player might need. Say a model or texture they might whip over and look at needs to be in memory or it's going to take forever to pop in as it's streamed off of a hard drive or heaven forbid an optical disk. Well, the PS5 changes this by shipping with such a high performance SSD that pertinent data can be pulled off of it while the player is moving around. Gaming developers to create much higher fidelity environments without tricks, like strategically placed elevator rides to mask background asset loading. This will enable new environments and experiences that weren't possible without this approach. Although you might only see them in PlayStation exclusive titles. The second is slow loading times. I remember first diving into this. When I went back to play some ancient game on a PC that I had recently upgraded, only to realize that even though my hardware, including an SSD, was many times faster, the game still took a long time to load. The reason for that is that there are a ton of potential bottlenecks, both in software and hardware, between raw ones and zeros coming off of an SSD and it being in a form and place that your program can actually use it. And the faster your SSD becomes, believe it or not, the more painful these bottlenecks become. We encountered this when we built our new high speed NVMe video editing server. Going on Linux, going from just a simple data streaming benchmark to adding just file system overhead, cut our throughput down to a fraction and was enough to bring a 24 core Epic server CPU to its knees, requiring us to upgrade it. Windows didn't even make it that far. Sony's solution was to create their own controller for the SSD that interfaces via PCIe Gen 4 with their main custom chip with much finer control over the priority of data access requests. This allows the game to say, hey, yeah, that stuff you were doing? I know you're going to be done soon, but I really need something right now. Get it to me. That's pretty cool, all on its own, when you consider how few players there are left in the SSD controller space, let alone how few of them are making high performance controllers. The real secret sauce though, is in the main custom chip, whose IO complex contains hardware to ensure that only the necessary data is loaded in memory, allows the game to shuffle data directly to where it needs to go, cutting out middle steps and bottlenecks, and this is a really cool one. Hardware level support for high speed decoding of compressed data stored on the SSD. That turns the 5.5GB per second of raw throughput into, according to Mark Sony's presentation, 8 or 9GB. Or even as much as 22GB per second of data. And the best part about it is that instead of needing an X86 processor that could cost hundreds of dollars, just dedicated to data decompression in every single PlayStation, they're doing this with minimal CPU overhead by using fixed function hardware. On the subject of compression, a third benefit of Sony's new approach is that games will get smaller. One of the little tricks that game developers use to minimize hard drive seek times is to store the data needed for a given area the player might explore in contiguous chunks to avoid fragmentation and data seeking. The problem is that any asset that appears many times in the game, like a stop sign, for example, needs to be stored in basically every one of those chunks, or you end up seeking around for it. That wastes a lot of space. Now arguably this one is a benefit of any SSD, where there is no seek time, but because both new gen consoles will use SSDs, it's something game developers won't have to worry about for the first time. That is, unless they're also releasing on PC. Watch out guys, because after all the moaning the PC's elits have done about... The PC might be about to become the lowest common denominator here. Unless the powers that be all come together to make it happen. Bottom line, Mr. Sweeney probably knows things that we don't, but even based on what we can see for ourselves, if what Sony is saying is true, he wasn't shilling for the PS5. I'll take my word for it, watch this great take from the Terno, reacting to Mark Sony's presentation. Besides, I doubt Mr. Sweeney cares much what platform you play on, as long as developers are using Unreal Engine, and making great games that lots of people buy. And if anything, think about this. Epic Games has more to game by pushing the PC to new heights, because now they've got a separate branch of their business charging even developers who don't use Unreal Engine for distribution on the Epic Games Store. To imagine that he's got some kind of agenda against PC is ridiculous. In summary, I still have a lot more to learn, and questions that I'd like answers to. Like how much of the PC's problems stem from OS kernel bottlenecks versus GPU driver ones? Whether a powerful enough CPU could make up for those shortfalls today, or how direct storage could change things for the PC going forward. But understandably, Mr. Sweeney didn't want to answer my questions at this time, and I get it, so that can wait for another day. All that's left say then is just to say sorry to a number of people. First, I'm sorry to myself, for not wearing steel toad boots on May 15th. It would have been a lot less painful when I pointed the gun at my foot and pulled the trigger. Oww! Number two is I'm sorry to my staff who fly under my banner. I like to think that usually they get to share my successes, but today they had to shoulder fallout from my mistake. This was an entirely avoidable own goal, and you guys deserve better. Three, I'm more sorry to my viewers. I have a responsibility to you guys to spread knowledge and understanding, not the opposite. I set some of you on the wrong path. It was a breach of our trust, and I can do better. And then finally, once more, I'm especially sorry to Mr. Sweeney, who might not give a who to about my blunder or my apology, and I would understand that. But who still had the class to take time out of his very busy life to respond to me in a professional manner, and this is after I called his statement he never made stupid, and carelessly clogged up his notifications with nonsense tweets that he's had to waste his time responding to, rather than focusing on what we all would prefer that he do, enabling groundbreaking gaming experiences for us to enjoy. Thank you for the lesson, sir. I help I have completed it to your satisfaction, and we can move past this. I do have a writing staff, and it would be easy to assume that I enlisted their help to prepare this given the stark difference between my past behavior and what I'm saying today. But I didn't, because I felt it was important for you to hear this in completely my own words. Not expecting a response, but I'm still going to throw it out there that if you guys have something cool in the pipe, I'm still not too old or too jaded to learn the patience and humility to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem when it comes to helping gamers better understand the technology that brings us all so much joy."
050_Cry,"I have a weird position on YouTube where I've seen a lot of things from a lot of perspectives and angles and something that a lot of people myself included. So before you start to think you're a fucking hypocrite, I want you to understand that I'm coming at this from a perspective of someone who genuinely does not like past me because past me was immature. Past me didn't accept that he could actually be wrong. Past me thought he was infallible. Every single time somebody makes a mistake in the world and people are like, man, I hope nobody finds out. And I think the thing that people realize is that's because from the fucking get-go, we're just taught man mistake better hide it otherwise I'm going to be in trouble. We forgot to actually teach lessons instead of just getting mad. And so people grow up with a lot of pride and they realize man, I'm so perfect. So if anybody fucks up, I'm going to project a lot of insecurities on those people because I'm infallible. When I was younger, I started this YouTube because I didn't really have a purpose in life. I needed something to give me some kind of purpose. I didn't have any actual confidence. I got my confidence from people telling me man, you're great. That was immature. Also doing this, I had never really left my room for so long. I'd grown so much that I didn't realize I was a fucking adult but I was mentally a child that is not an excuse for the record. I've always felt disingenuine because I was never open with people about things because I was always hiding things. I was never able to be genuine with people anymore after the fact that I cheated on my girlfriend with people who I didn't realize even underage in the first place. So yes, I'm sorry. But I promise you I'm not that same fucking person anymore. And I resent that person who I was. And I'm sorry that I was hiding who I was this whole time. I've never wanted to be on a pedestal in the first place. And I think that's because I was always afraid of people knowing who I really was. Just some lonely guy trying to find a purpose. Just some lonely guy who genuinely is someone who would be considered a basement well but luckily I live in Florida. So there's no basements. It took me 31 years. It took me until 10 minutes before my 31st birthday to realize I was going in a constant projection of fucking nothing because I never really accepted who I was. I always made excuses and I'm fucking sorry for that. I'm not going to say anymore because this is not some pity party. This is more addressing the things I need to be said. More so than giving people their dirt or tea or whatever the fuck they need. I just feel like people need to be able to express themselves. Be them victims or not. I always consider myself a victim because of the way I was raised. However that kind of mentality made me the actual instigator as opposed to the protagonist that I always thought I was because everyone said you're so perfect all the time. That's a horrible mindset to take and everyone should really be able to look into themselves and see that they need to grow. They need to stop excusing every little thing they do because they're afraid of the repercussions. As soon as you start being afraid of the repercussions you stop growing. I'm sorry. Genuinely. I have in the description an enlisted video showing that I would really like people to understand that it is okay to express their feelings. I feel like a lot of people are afraid of ridicule, prejudice isn't bullying. They are afraid of people picking on them because they're showing their genuine human emotion. I feel like people need to be okay with doing that. Even if it makes them be the bad guy because that's the most human thing you can possibly do. I'm fucking sorry again but I promise I've changed. See you in the next one."
051_Shane,"Hi, if you've been watching me for a while, then you know that I have done a lot of things in my past that I hate, that I wish I could make go-way, that I try to make go-way by deleting videos or untagging my Instagram things or literally doing whatever I can to pretend like those things didn't happen. Because yes I apologize for a lot of them but I'm 31, almost 32, those apologies suck. I don't know who that person is anymore. Every apology video I've ever made has been from fear. It's me sitting at home thinking the whole world hates me and crying and hyperventilating and then just turning on a webcam and just saying I'm sorry and then hoping people know I'm a good person and then it'll go away and that is stupid. That is something that a child does. Not something that a 31 year old man does. That's not good. Right now is very much a time of wanting people to be accountable, wanting punishment for people and I agree and that's why I'm making this video. I saw Jenna Marbles video and it really inspired me and felt like a sign from the universe that I want to do this. So this this video is coming from a place of just wanting to own up to my shit, wanting to own up to everything I've done on the internet that has hurt people that has added to a problem that has not been handled well. Like I should have been punished for things. I feel like this moment right now is very necessary. I'm going to apologize for a lot of things that I've done or said in this video and if you don't accept the apology that is 100% okay. I think that's something that I as I'm getting older now and realizing it's like you can apologize but you can't expect the other person to just forgive you. Like that's that doesn't make any sense. So I think this video for me is more about just saying everything I want to say and ways that I want to help be a part of a change and not be a part of a problem which is what I've been a part of. So I'm going to start with all the racism that I put onto the internet as a adult, not a child. I was at least 20 when I started YouTube and I made the decision to play stereotypes of black people or Asian people or Mexicans or pretty much every race I made that decision. I said oh this is funny and I put it on the internet. Now years later I look back at that and I've talked about this before but I when I say I hate that person I mean it in the most intense way possible. I hate that person so much. That person was filled with sadness, filled with anger about their own issues in the closet constantly projecting on others just like I don't know just that that person is someone who I don't like seeing and I think that's why I've been avoiding this because I'm like no I already apologize I don't want to go back I don't want to see it again I don't want to see muted on Twitter. Untagged on my Instagram like I just don't I hate that person so fucking much. Okay so sorry so first let's start with blackface. Blackface was something that I did a lot like I did it a lot on my channel and there's no excuse for it there's literally no excuse I made a video of six years ago talking about it and I gave excuses and I knew it was wrong and I knew I never wanted to do it again but I didn't do the work I didn't actually look into the history of it and why it's so wrong and why people were so upset because my excuse oh I was I was just being funny I love black people I'm not racist I was trying to be funny like I all of that is stupid and wrong and I put that onto the internet as an adult and that is insane. I'm so sorry I am so sorry to anybody that saw that and that also saw that people were lifting me up and we're saying you're so funny Shane oh my god you're so funny like I can't even put myself in that head I can't even imagine what it would be like to be black and to see this white fucking guy do blackface and the whole internet at that time being like oh well that's insane and I am so sorry I don't know how to even fully apologize because it almost it seems like something that is irredeemable or I don't know the right word but it's something that I shouldn't even be able to get out of I should lose everything for that I can tell you this I don't have hate for any race or any people with weight issues or or any of that special needs I don't have hate in my heart for anyone but it doesn't make up for the fact that I made jokes about everyone and some of the jokes were way too far and I think this year specifically really changed me as a person and I started seeing black people who I know who I'm friends with who I've known for a long time I'm seeing them openly talking about on their Instagram or Twitter the years of anger they've had about racist jokes about blackface about you know microaggressions everything that they've gone through and I felt like the biggest piece of shit in the entire world I felt awful and the biggest problem with me doing that and posting it on the internet was it made young people at the time who were watching me think it was okay and and that's a crazy part it's like I've had people tell me well I used to watch your videos when I was a kid and yeah I never saw anything wrong with that and that is scary because it made me realize oh my god I have been a part of such a huge problem and I have just been avoiding it and that's wrong so I'm so sorry I'm sorry that I added to the normalization of blackface or the normalization of saying the N word that's another thing I mean and am I justification at the time for that was oh it was you know I was playing a character and it was in comedy and my black friend was there and you know that makes it okay no it's not okay and it's not a funny word especially for a white person to say me as a white person wearing a wig and playing a character and doing stereotypes and then saying the N word is something that I should have probably lost my career for at the time and there's no amount of apologizing that can take it away and take away the impact it had and take away the amount of people that have been hurt by that or have felt like I I was just oh another white guy who can get away with everything when I really looked into the history of blackface I looked into it years ago and it obviously disgusted me made me sick I felt awful but even at that time I still was being ignorant and I was saying in my head well but I didn't do that you know I was playing Wendy Williams or I was playing a character that justification that is wrong I mean I've watched so many videos on the history of blackface and how it was created to make fun of black people to make them feel less than and the fact that I in some way was a part of that like the fact that the word blackface now will forever be attached to me that's the level at which I have been lately just feeling very awful about myself about what I did about the jokes I've made about the videos I've made I'm wanting to disassociate from that person but I can't now there was one person who really tried to get through to me for a long time and her name is Cheska Lee and probably seven years ago she was she's a YouTuber and she tweeted me and we got into fights back and forth and my audience at the time was saying racist things to her and it was so toxic and I'm so sorry and it's so gross and there's no amount of apologizing for it and I think I was taking everything as an attack which is so stupid like looking back that is stupid I was taking as an attack like I'm not racist leave me alone I'm not racist and you know it's like okay but look what you're making Shane like that I don't know how I didn't see that that is scary and I'm sorry but one of my biggest problems was thinking that criticism is being attacked oh somebody's telling me that I did something wrong I'm gonna go on the defensive and that's not a good way to live and it's not a good way to grow and change and actually help people so speaking of Francesca there is something on Twitter right now that people are shaming and I got a text about it today and my heart completely broke and it was from my podcast from five years ago now in the clip I am talking about the segment was about murder fantasies like oh there's somebody that you really hate or your mad at and you know have you ever had fantasized about murdering them and how would you do it stupid gross awful something I would never talk about now that podcast is a source of so much awful shit for me so many regrets for me and I loved a lot of those moments but a lot of them were like what did we do to make it crazier how do we make things more insane oh how do we make it more shocking like Howard Stern like it just got to a point where I'm happy it ended because I wasn't even myself I don't even know who I was at that point anyways so in the segment I started talking about you know figuratively murdering someone and it was insane and gross now she believes and a lot of people believe that I was talking about her and I can say if I had a Bible I would put my hand on it I can say without a doubt hand on a Bible that was not about Francesca Lee that was about another woman not that it makes it okay because it doesn't talking about anybody like that is crazy especially a woman but it was about a white woman and the ironic part is that woman was just trying to get through to me too like she was just trying to explain to me why what I was making on the internet is hurting people it was at a time when I was making a movie and I was constantly on the defensive I felt attacked all the time which is stupid I shouldn't have felt like that and it got so bad that I don't know it almost made me want to make the jokes crazier to make everything crazier almost like is a you know screw you I'm just gonna make it crazier and that's one reason it's hard for me to watch that movie because I would never make a movie like that no ever in my whole life there was so many offensive jokes in it that were so cheap and shitty and stupid and there was a woman involved who was constantly giving me criticism and telling me that I needed to stop making so many offensive jokes and the reason I was so upset wasn't just because of that there's so many other reasons I mean this this person really tried to I don't know there there was a lot they tried to ruin my relationship they it was it was it was a lot I had a lot of anger for this person so that anger is gone by the way it's all gone and I'm so sorry to her and I'm sorry to Francesca and I should have never talked about anybody like that ever and that's the other thing the podcast I mean there's so many clips that people are bringing up so there's a clip that has been going around again a few years ago is when it came out and they cut out all the parts where I said you know pedophilia is disgusting and they put it together and it made it seem like I was you know talking about how it's normal so gross I would never say that but also I shouldn't have been joking about it anyways which is my problem my fault so I'm sorry if you heard that there's also other ones too I mean and that's something I have addressed before but my childhood my past I've had a lot of pain I've had a lot of bad things happen to me I've had a lot of issues with my family and I took that pain and I turned it into jokes and I think instead of joking about them so much I probably should have just went to therapy earlier and talked about them I swear on my life I am not somebody who would ever talk about a child like insurious I would never talk about a child in any way that was inappropriate that is disgusting that is gross is not something I would ever do it is something I did for shock value or because I thought it was funny or like oh my god my child my straccharacter or whatever it's all gross and I promise that is not real that is not me have I done sketches where kids were saying crazy things yes do I regret it yes even I saw a vlog clip of me and my cousin who was I don't know probably 12 or 13 at the time and we were you know I was doing the birds in the bees talk I don't grow shit and I remember a few years ago I reached out to her mom my aunt and I was like I'm so sorry oh my god I can't believe I did this like this is insane I can't believe I talked to you know my cousin like that and you know she was like oh my god we know we know it's okay it was funny like we all thought it was funny like that's just how our family is so I kind of took that is like okay well then I don't need to apologize for it but I do because I posted it on the internet for everyone not just my family that wasn't I posted like a stupid weird family moment for everyone I'm so sorry that I just was so thoughtless with things I was posting for so many years I just I don't know I just wasn't I wasn't thinking I thought I thought oh I'm in a weird category where I can say whatever I want and I did and now it's the biggest regret of my entire life all of it now even though my apologies in the past for all of these things have not been good enough they've not been thought out they've been very fear-based they've been not not good at all I do want to say since I've apologized for those things in the past I have made a lot of changes in my life changes in just every every every facet of me has changed I'm not just saying it I'm not just saying oh I'm gonna stop doing that guys I did stop doing that I stopped doing that stuff years ago I don't use any racial slurs in my life I've never used a racial slur in anger ever in my life that is not me that has never been me I am not a hateful person I am somebody who took jokes too far and was really really really stupid and inappropriate so all of those apologies if you accept them thank you if you don't I a hundred percent understand because there was a lot and a lot of that is stuff that you probably will never forgive me for and maybe you didn't know about all those old videos I a hundred percent understand I'm willing to lose everything at this point realizing how many people I've hurt or how many people I've inspired to say awful things or or do anything awful like to finally just own up to all of this and be accountable is worth losing everything to me and I am not saying that as like a lie or for sympathy I'm being honest I want to spend the rest of my life doing things that I love with my heart that I'm excited about and things that aren't hurting anyone aren't offending anyone and I want to learn more and I don't want to be someone who's afraid of my past so thank you for hearing me out on all of those issues I promise I'm gonna do better to even more so educate myself put more people on my channel that aren't just white youtubers in trouble like that I'm totally aware of how that looks somebody pointed that out to me a couple years ago and I got really defensive over it and now I'm looking back going no they're right they're right if you look at my channel it's a bunch of white people and talking about their problems and I love a lot of those videos and I'm so proud of those videos but you're right I need to open up what I'm doing for everyone so last week I went on Twitter and it had been about two weeks of me getting people constantly saying address it address it address it talking about the James and Tati situation I was just gonna ignore it and then when I started hearing oh Shane mastermind the whole thing it didn't sit well with me because it's not true so when I finally addressed it I wrote this Twitter note which was such a mistake I wrote it in I had a restock for the conspiracy collection and I woke up and I felt really weird like we had been pushing the restock for so long that we finally had to do it and when I woke up and it was out I just felt so weird I felt so guilty I didn't want to and I couldn't enjoy it I didn't want to enjoy this restock when there's something that I haven't addressed that people are really really upset at me for it so I sat down and I wrote that essay which I wrote it to be funny it didn't come across that way it came across very angry which it was but it was also supposed to be funny it just was a huge miss in every single way so the part of the Twitter note that I regret more than anything in my life was a part where I said that James deserved a slice of humble pie the size of the Empire State Building I only want to talk about this situation with love because I feel like that note had so much anger in it it was just not good and so I'm gonna come at this situation by first apologizing I'm sorry James I'm really sorry first of all nobody deserves what happened nobody the whole internet ganging up on someone nobody deserve that and who am I to say that somebody needs to be humbled me like who am I to say that I literally have put so much hate onto the internet over my last 15 years of YouTube world like I have put so much shit and I'm sitting here like well because I changed and because I'm nice and this and that like yeah you need to be humbled it's like that sucks I hate that that was so immature and gross and I'm so sorry and I know a lot of people are saying that well why did you say you're leaving the beauty community you were never in it and you're right I don't know why I said that that was stupid I was never in the beauty world because a lot of the beauty people that I watch and I'm not just saying that I think a lot of people think I'm lying when I say I really love the makeup world and I'm really invested in it I'm not lying for the last year I've been watching beauty channels every day my whole homepage is just beauty channels and it's smaller ones so to know that I hurt those people who are problematic and who just love makeup and who have been working their ass off for years for me to shit on that I am so sorry also I'm aware of how hypocritical it is for me to say I'm above this tea and drama channels and drama and I'm not like that and that is so stupid it's so dumb at that moment I was so upset with certain things it was just me being upset and it is hypocritical I mean I watch drama videos but when it's about me oh now it's a problem like and I'm aware of how hypocritical that is and I'm so sorry this is a huge one I'm aware that I hold my friends or people I care about to a lower standard than I hold other people that's wrong and I'm so sorry I think I get attached to people who have a heart and maybe it's covered in a lot of stuff and maybe they have a lot of issues but I almost feel like I am attracted to other broken people who have issues and I want to help and I want to fix them or I want to help people see a better side of them and I'm aware that I'm friends with some people that you know have done some bad things on the internet and I don't condone it and I don't co-sign it and that is something that I've always addressed with them privately I'm ready to to own up to this stuff and I'm ready to hopefully show you guys that it's okay to admit when you're wrong it's okay to be upset at your past self for making mistakes but also it's okay if people don't want to accept your apology or if people don't want to support you anymore that's okay too and I understand if you watching this video right now feel that way please like I don't ever want you to feel like I'm forcing you to forgive me that is not what I want to do and I promise that I'm going to show you through my actions and I promise that whatever I do next will be putting good into the world and it won't be putting hate or drama or anything negative and I'm gonna stick by that so thank you for watching this if you watch the whole thing thank you so much and I hope that you learned some lessons from me especially if you're young I hope you learned a lot of lessons from everything that I have done put out into the world mistakes I've made I hope that you can see that and know that it's never too late to address it and to change"
052_Liza,"You can be someone who has no intention to be racist, but because you're conditioned in a world that is racist and a country that is structured in anti-Black racism, you yourself can perpetuate those ideas,"" Ibram X. Kendi, author, historian and leading scholar of race and discriminatory policy in America. No matter what color you are. This quote was shared with me in conversation a couple of weeks ago, and has been sitting in my heart ever since. While we focus on systemic anti-Black racism in our country, I've been hesitant to center my voice. My work has been within but I now recognize and take responsibility for the times I was not the ally I am becoming today. Being anti-racist requires a personal reckoning, and I can't in good faith continue to use my platform for progress without taking accountability myself. I am taking inventory, taking initiative and taking note that my impact and influence will weigh greater than my intention. What I once thought of as ""innocent jokes"" were actually tainted with implicit bias, and what might have been intended as ""playful"" was actually to some, incredibly painful. And for that, I am so sorry. As a woman of color and a self-defined ""little brown girl,"" I have experienced the harm of prejudices in my own life. However, this reality does not exempt me from the responsibility of acknowledging the times I've unknowingly perpetuated racist ideas. I see now that some of my previous influences and my own past thinking, speaking and storytelling reinforced stereotypes. I created characters of different cultures with the intent of celebrating them, but with the impact of appropriating them. IMPACT outweighs INTENT. I am sorry to the beautiful communities that I have caused hurt within. It takes a combination of individual and collective reckoning with our past to heal and move forward together. Consider this my resignation from ignorance, and my declaration as an ally in action. I will give grace, make space and break these damn systems in place like my life depends on it... because too many do. Thank you to my guardian angels in life and online who have been gracefully guiding this growth of mine, and I thank God for my continued awakening."
053_JKN," With everything that has come to light this weekend and just everything that's been getting attention in the past few months, we feel that it's necessary for us to address some of the fucked up shit that we've done in the past. And today we're going to take accountability for us and for everyone that is associated with us. I think one of the things I'm super like blessed though is all of our loyal viewers who've watched us for many, many years and they were a part of the process of seeing us grow from like immature young men and to immature old men. And we've said a lot of stupid shit and we've done a lot of stupid things. A lot of them wrong. Now looking back it's like I should have never said or done a lot of those things, especially with so many young impressionable fans. One of the topics that's like that is the whole cancel culture thing where in the beginning I'm like what the hell is all this? All I ever do is see like celebrities give these fake apology videos and it almost seems like you see it so much that it loses its meaning. It's the public is mad about something so they demand an apology and it almost sounds like the apology is coming from the celebrities like fear rather than from his heart. And now and especially this year like seeing all the crazy things unfold is just a huge time of awakening. I have a completely different view of cancel culture and I feel like there's a value and there's a reason why it needs to be done because people need to be held accountable. I think we're pretty good at being comedians and I don't think we have to rely on jokes that put other people down. I always think that sometimes you need to like take drastic measures so that people will listen. And with cancel culture like I don't even know if it's cancel culture it might just be like people speaking out because of sexual harassment or it could even be like people are upset about racism. And so like for me now I have a more open perspective of like instead of writing it off as cancel culture right. Like there's a lot of things that we have to look at ourselves and what did we do wrong? Was there ever a point in time when we hurt people through our comedy or maybe our opinions or maybe you know there's a lot of the times on JK News where I'm just workshopping an idea and I speak out of my ass and I don't even know what I'm saying. And that's not an excuse but because I'm not well thought out I can be pretty hurtful. And I think that's you know inexcusable because I guess with the platform that we have I should think a little bit more before I say stuff. And if I did hurt people like now I want to take a look at like what am I saying that is where I got to check my way of thinking. One of the things that I fucked up on was I made the decision to put on black face to play a character for a skip. I was stupid and I didn't see how wrong it was but now looking back it's something that I'm actually really ashamed of. And even in addition to that like in a bunch of videos we've said the n word a bunch of times and the old excuse was like oh that's how we grew up or you know when you grow up in the hood everyone says it's okay but it's not okay you know and we have like all these videos of just all kinds of things of almost not violations but a lot of it was hurtful to a lot of hurtful to a lot of people and a lot of instances where some are big and blatant and some are just really small and mild but none of them are okay. And so I think it's important that I apologize for every single one of those. I think it's important that I acknowledge that those videos are bad and I'm ashamed that those are bad and that I changed the way that I made content from this point of. And what really sucks right now is our entire country feels like it's in a bad marriage. Like in a marriage you're supposed to love each other and you're supposed to be dedicated to the well being of each other. The biggest thing that's getting in the way of understanding is not communicating, having a strong ego and not willing to listen and I think in order for us to fix that we have to be able to talk to each other and put our ego aside and go to therapy and be willing to learn, hold ourselves accountable and make change afterwards. I went out to support BLM with Asian organizations and we went out to March and to me I just want to show up for people out there that it's all of us against racism and even though I've might have been someone who's perpetuated racism in the past. That's not my goal in the future and I want to learn from that. And to show that I think it's very important for people like us, people with an audience to speak out against it and stand against it and show physically that we're here to support a new world and a new society that racism just doesn't exist here. One of the things I recently learned from the past shoot last week is complacency is actually supporting racism and it's not enough to just stand by and go, hey I'm being neutral and I'm being passive and I don't want to get involved. In order to fight racism, everyone has to actually take an action and take a stand and move against the opposite direction and that's what I'm committed to do, that's what Joe's committed to do and that's what JK as a company is committed to do. For the non-black fans out there who are watching and you want to show support like thanks but do it silently. We want to leave platform and space for our black fans to speak so in the comments section we would love to hear what you have to say. We're also committed to donating to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and we're going to be doing our part by researching and continuously finding organizations that we can help and support. We're sorry it took so long for us to realize but now I think this is day one of our growth and from this it can only go up where we're going to continuously learn from our mistakes."
054_Tati,"It's been a long time coming for me to share with you some very, very important things. And I am going to be reading from what is approved by my legal team. So I am once I start getting into what I need to share with you guys today. What I feel is important to share with you. I won't be deviating and it's at the advice of my legal counsel. So there's so much going on on YouTube and in the world. And I just, first off, I do want to request something. Actually before that, I just want to tell you that I missed you guys. A lot. And I'm sorry that you haven't seen me in a while. And I'm hoping that this video clears up a lot of the reasons why I felt I could not be online over the past couple of months. I have missed making videos and I've missed you so, so much. But I do want to ask anyone watching this that believes in anything higher than themselves, that believes in any higher power, you know, all higher power. All God is love and the root of love. And I am a woman of faith and I've been praying every day over this event scandal, whatever you want to name it. And I just ask that you press pause for a moment. And even just for 10 seconds, just cover this in prayer because there is so much healing that needs to take place. There was a lot of injustice and there's a lot of truth that needs to come forward. But it is not going to be easy and it's very painful. And I don't wish harm or hate on anyone. And I just want to make that very, very clear. I'm an imperfect person. And I do my best to be caring kind and loving and I screw up and I make bad choices. And I think that we all right now we go online and it's really easy to make terrible choices, even with how you cast a vote on your, what your opinion is of someone's, you know, news story or, you know, whatever is going on in the world or just anything you see in the media right now, be mindful, you know, we're made to feel like we have to follow the herd. And there are so many AI bots and accounts that aren't even real, that influence your opinion on whatever narrative is out there. And it is just left me feeling really heartbroken. If enough people have one opinion about something, it feels like the masses turn the tide really quickly. And I've witnessed that and I feel like I've experienced that with my own scandal, but it's even worse like stepping back from the picture not being like so close up to it and actually stepping back. And with all of the sadness going on in the world, you see how quickly the tides turn. And I just want to inspire you guys, or just empower you actually to look further into yourself and your own opinions and don't follow the herd, follow your heart really because I thought I was following mine, but I was listening to the wrong people. So if you can take anything from this, it's listen to your, your heart first and always and don't bend on that. I feel like sometimes we're afraid to be ourselves in this world. Like our freedom of speech is expanded in areas and limited in others because the second that someone jumps and disagrees, it feels like so many jump with that and you feel voiceless and afraid to speak up. And I think that's a scary part of the world right now that some of the good is suppressed and voiceless. And I'm not here for that and I want to speak as much of my truth as I legally and permitted to do. And so I'm going to share what I can and I love you all so much and I'm grateful for anyone that has come here to hear my experience of 2019. So talking publicly about a wound in my heart that I don't think will ever fully heal is not something I ever wanted to do. I avoided it, even though I felt the heaviness of so much disappointment until today, I made no comment and I have made every effort to move through this with dignity. The reality is every day I've struggled quietly trying to rebuild my now poisoned reputation. The heartbreak that was born from the scandal still lingers and I feel it won't ever have the opportunity to completely heal until I uncovered the truth from all parties involved and their motivation of it all. For over a year now, every time the scandal is revisited, either in the mainstream media or through social platforms, I've become the number one target of relentless hate while remaining voiceless. I've lost over a year of my life terrified of social media and terrified of speaking up against the people that used coerced and manipulated me into uploading my video in May of last year. As a result, the damage to my health, relationships, reputation, business and general well-being have been enormous. The platform that I love, this platform that saved my life and that changed my life has become toxic and what it needs now more than ever are peacemakers. We need to find our way back to the beginning through forgiveness and leading with love. We need to rebuild a safe place to escape again. Our world seems to be falling apart all around us, so the last thing you need me to do is fuel more hate by releasing my receipts and voice memos. But I know many of you are needing some answers as well as a long overdue apology for the role that I played. Also, by the way, these are my words. I did write this and this is from my heart, but I am being careful here and I think you guys understand why. Back in December 2019, after Shane and Jeffrey's series ended, James Charles came to my LA home and we compared DMs, texts and stories about what had happened behind the scenes. We apologized to each other, forgave each other, and agreed to wait patiently until it was safe for me to share my story. Since that night, James Charles has repeatedly said that he wanted to be beside me for this video. But I felt it was important that I do it alone because he deserves my first apology. And I am really sorry, James. And I've said that privately, but I want you to hear it publicly. I'm sorry. To provide some context, it's important for you to know that I love James Charles. He has a special place in my heart. And that never changed even when I was hurt. I promised my dad I wasn't going to cry. I've been trying to feel... I feel... I've been trying to feel strong enough to do this video because I want to feel strong. I don't feel like I'm able to talk about any of this without getting emotional. So... Forgive my emotions. This is really difficult stuff. I was always more of a mentor than a friend to James Charles. I was someone he could lean on if he needed advice. He came into my life after he had sent me a tweet in 2016, and I met him in person for the first time at a generation beauty event in New York. Not long after that, his cover girl deal was made public, and he was off to the races. I was a proud friend, and I wanted nothing but good things for him. A few months later, he was a guest at my wedding where he did my makeup for my wedding day. It's still my favorite memory of us, as it was a gift getting to know him before all of the success. James Charles has made his fair share of mistakes and has been in scandals. We all have, but I always believed in him as he had a rare ability to improve himself through any situation. In the past, if I was upset, it never lasted long. He is gifted with turning pain into strength, and I've always admired that. However, prior to the scandal last May, I'd started growing frustrated with what I perceived as a progressing sense of entitlement, and I felt that he was making some detrimental choices that could jeopardize his career and safety. None of my concerns became overwhelming until after I met Shane Dawson. When I made my video, I expressed my opinions about James Charles's behavior. I expressed how much a specific decision he made that I perceived as betrayal, hurt me. I was very worried and heartbroken, but I did not lie in that video. I never called James Charles a p*****er, and I never said that James Charles was a danger to society. My video was not made with any malice. I did not publicly err any of the horrific accusations that were being made behind the scenes. While I was definitely upset that he had accepted a sponsorship from the biggest rival to my brand Halo Beauty, I did not make my video because of vitamins. I made it as a result of all of the poisonous lies that were fed to me by Shane Dawson and Jeffrey Star. James Charles is sugar bear hair sponsorship and all of the drama that had kicked up afterwards. That was just my breaking point. Yes, I'm a grown woman. I'm smart. I can usually spot deceit and manipulation a mile away, but my guard was down from being heartbroken, and I allowed myself to be worked by Shane, Jeffrey, and others. After my video went up, I was never served a lawsuit or any cease and desist letters. I only privateed my video at the request of YouTube, because YouTube said it was a bad look for their platform. James, I am so sorry that I allowed myself to be poisoned and weaponized against you. I'm sorry that I bought into any of their lies, believing those lies, and allowing myself to be gaslit into making that video is one of the biggest regrets of my life. I should have tried harder to reach you over those concerns in person. And I'm sorry for giving up. The information they were giving me was terrifying. I thought your career and freedom were in jeopardy. I was trying to get you to put your phone down and seek help, because I was told there were a lot of victims that were going to come forward to destroy you. I was foolish for believing them. I was scared. I thought if I called you out, you would put your phone down, and stop the detrimental behavior. I was being made to believe was true. James, I apologize for uploading that video. I should have known better than to fall for their lies and manipulation, but in the end, I failed. And instead, I allowed Shane and Jeffrey to put a wedge between our friendship. Jeffrey's star first contacted me early in his YouTube career wanting to meet. But it wasn't until 2017 that we started speaking. I knew that Jeffrey had had a lot of drama in his past, but when he came to me, he presented himself as someone who had changed and was trying to be better. I saw his pain and I felt that I could be a positive influence. As time went on, I learned that being friends with Jeffrey's star was like being friends with a lion. Yes, he may have been dangerous, but he was always really kind to me. From time to time, I would see improvements, which were followed by setbacks thereafter. But overall, I thought he was growing as a person, and again, I thought I could be a good example for him. I even tried to get him involved with my favorite charity, Diverting from Script PS. Because I am going to be speaking on my real life more freely, I hope, in the future and the things that I think are important. I have participated in this charity for years on end now, and I love their work. I had it in my head that if I could pull Jeffrey somehow into being a role model or feeling like a role model, that could be really empowering to him. And when you empower someone to feel good about feeling good, it will help them change. And if you just tear someone down, no change. So I did try to get him involved with my favorite charity, Spirit Awakening Foundation, which helps at-risk kids that had found themselves in legal trouble but are trying to change their lives for the better. My intentions with Jeffrey were good, but I was a fool for thinking that I could ever help him become a better person. Which brings me back to another long overdue apology. Jackie Aina. Jackie, the moment that Jeffrey went off. The moment that Jeffrey went off on you. The day before my first video collab with him went live. I should have run for the hills. I was nagging. I was excited about the video. I got it twisted that you had provoked Jeffrey because you were angry that I had filmed with someone who had a history of being labeled by others as a racist. Jackie, I'm sorry that I did not do the right thing and walk away from him then. I should have not been blind to the reasons behind the accusations of his racism. I shouldn't have depended him and I regret any of the pain that I may have caused you. And for the record loud and clear, I've always liked you and I've always enjoyed you every interaction that we've had face to face. And I let you down and I am so genuinely sorry for that. In 2018 I saw from the sidelines what happened in Dramaghen wine with Manny Laura Gabriel in the quidah. That should have been to me some big red flag of what happens when Jeffrey is unhappy with someone. But for some twisted sense of civic duty, I thought it was my responsibility to stay in Jeffrey's life and try to help him become a better person. When Shane Dawson's first series with Jeffrey happened from all outside appearances, it looked like Jeffrey was actually changing for the better. He was accepting responsibility for things that had happened in his past and he was pledging to be a better person. I believed him again. During those first two years of knowing Jeffrey, it's important to note that we did not actually spend much time together. I was invited a few times to go to his home, but I usually declined. On the two occasions that I did go to his home, I did not stay long because I don't smoke marijuana and I just don't like to be rounded. Likewise, he came to my home on a few occasions and he also did not stay long. So the vast majority of our relationship was primarily by FaceTime, telephone or texts. Sometimes weeks or months would go by without hearing anything from him, but I always heard from him when he was involved in drama or when he had a new launch about to happen. Though I recognized this pattern, any suspicion that I had of being used was clouded by the hopes that he actually cared for me and that I was a positive influence in his life. As a result, I usually would take his snarky statements about others with a grain of salt. One thing that he did that did concern me a lot was how he would frequently comment about how much dirt he held on other brand owners and members of our YouTube community. I believe that he actually held blackmail material on many people and was capable of destroying the entire community. This worried me about him and I stayed and I tried my best to be a positive influence. My opinion, he's going to go off guys and I don't think anyone, I don't think he will hold back and I think we need to be prepared. To understand that we need to forgive the people that he is holding hostage with veiled threats of exposure, we need to be prepared to forgive him. Otherwise this won't stop. So prepare to not cancel everyone and give them a chance. It's not right, it is not right to try to trap people into saying things that they wouldn't otherwise say. It's not right. I was blind, I was so blind. I don't want any part of it anymore. None. None. Back in 2019, Jeffrey started talking a lot more crap about James Charles unusual. It seemed that doing so had become his biggest obsession. It started with him telling me right before filming our collab together. For James Charles's channel, that James Charles actually didn't want me there, that he had wanted Nikki tutorials instead, but said he had had my back. Things further escalated at my birthday every time James Charles's back was turned. Jeffrey would tell me that James Charles was out of control. I didn't text, didn't call me the following morning to apologize for James Charles's behavior at my birthday dinner and how embarrassed he was for me. I initially dismissed it as jealousy because James Charles's career was on a rocket ship at the time, but as the weeks went by every time I saw her spoke with Jeffrey, it seemed to me that James was all he wanted to talk about. Jeffrey and his killer merch offices in March to discuss Jeffrey developing and managing my merch. As we were touring his warehouse that was filled with sisters apparel, it seemed that all he could do was speak poorly of James Charles. Over the next few weeks, Jeffrey began talking to me about how Shane Dawson was a big fan of mine and wanted to meet me and how I should be involved in their docuseries. Eventually Shane reached out to me by text and started DMing me on Instagram. Shane said I was the queen of makeup reviews on YouTube that I was his favorite beauty channel and he wanted me to teach him all about makeup. I didn't know much about Shane Dawson. I knew that he was viewed as the king of YouTube and he had done amazing series with bunny and I hadn't watched much of anything else other than Jake Paul series and of course the series with Jeffrey. In all honesty, I was looking forward to meeting Shane. I had actually hoped he would want to help me tell my personal story one day about all the pain and heartbreak in my life that led me to wanting to start my own YouTube channel back in 2010. I wish I had researched him better. I wish I had watched his old videos. I wish I had educated myself and I was aware of his earlier content. All I knew at the time was that Shane Dawson was the most adored documentary filmmaker on YouTube so I invited him over to my home to play with makeup and to get to know him. Shane came over one afternoon in April and I opened up and shared things that I've only shared with my closest of friends. I shared that I had in the victim of sexual assault. I spoke about my faith and told him how deeply I feel for others. He shared with me that he was an empath and that he could feel all of my pain. He pledged his unending friendship and loyal to me forever in this life and the next one. He told me that God had called me to be a beacon of light for the world so that it could be a better place. He also shared that Jeffrey had wanted me to have a small role in their docuseries. But the entire series was quickly changing because there was something horrible happening in our community with James Charles. He said that James Charles was a monster with many victims. Yes, I knew that Shane was friends with Jeffrey and that they were working together. But I thought to myself, why would Shane Dawson, the king of truth on YouTube, be turning against James Charles unless these things he was saying were true? Why would Shane sit in my home and spend so many hours telling me these horrific allegations if they were not true? Shane said that James Charles was a monster and that James Charles was hurting minors. Shane said he was planning to interview victims for the docuseries. He told me that something needed to be done to stop him from hurting more people. Over the course of the next few weeks, he and Jeffrey fed me so much information that I felt sick. Almost every day there was more information and new allegations. Eventually I started believing what they were saying because they said they had evidence. By the time the drama around James Charles's promotion of Sugar Bear Hair reached its peak, I was beyond gaslit. Shane Dawson didn't just know about my by-sister video. He offered to help edit it. He even offered to design the thumbnail and help title it. I declined his offer but his gesture supported and reinforced for me that he was telling the truth. While Swood he jeopardized his career. So surely Jeffrey was telling the truth too. Keep in mind that up until this point I didn't even know I was making a video. So how is it that so many editorial outlets knew that something was coming before I had even made a decision to film? I struggled with the decision to film my video for days. The night before I did film, Jeffrey sent me what he claimed was an audio file from unallegged victim and told me to listen to the pain in their voice. The audio was clearly a small portion of a larger conversation. It wasn't enough for me to contact the authorities. It was enough to scare me. As a victim of abuse myself, I know how terrifying it is. To think of facing public humiliation and legal proceedings. It wasn't my place to contact authorities. It was not my place to contact authorities or the alleged victim. And I made no mention of it in my video. The night before posting my video by sister, I texted Shane sharing my concerns for James Charles that he was out of the country on the high floor of a hotel and I was afraid for him hurting himself. Shane texted me back and said that I should not be nervous about the 50th floor that James Charles was a narcissist and that he would never do that. The day the video went up, Shane requested to come over to my home and film and document what was happening I declined. After a few days of Jeffrey fanning the flames on Twitter, no victims appeared as they had stated would happen and no evidence came forward as they stated would happen. The last time I spoke with either Jeffrey or Shane on the phone was the night before Jeffrey's never doing this again video. Shortly after the relationship dissolved entirely and I was so confused. I bought into the conspiracy theory that what happened was all a social experiment and that maybe James Charles was even involved. And that there was going to be a big reveal in Shane's docuseries. And that I would be the fool who fell for it. Shane never reached out, check on me. And he never shared the trailer with me. The last time we spoke on the phone was before Jeffrey's apology video and I asked him to not include the drama in the series. He only texted me after the trailer was live with an audio message telling me to not worry about it. The drama was only going to be one episode. For the next few months, I was tormented with sub-tweets and any window that there was a huge drama around the corner. I felt that I was a liability to them and that I knew too much. So I put all of my text messages and other files on a hard drive and told a few people that I was afraid for my life and had given everything to my lawyers. I was hoping that information would leak as I thought it might keep me safe. My mental and physical health suffered, my businesses suffered. That was all I could do to pull myself together for the launch of taughty beauty. That night helped me so much to everyone that came because I felt like I didn't have community anymore. And I was too ashamed to even think about inviting anyone from my community. And I'm just so grateful to myself as drivers that showed up for me. And I just hope that you're still there. I'm going to heart attack. Last fall, I became so afraid to stay in my L.I. home that I both filmed a lot of videos and I left town and October to get away from it all. I was so upset that I continued to lose weight. I couldn't sleep. And slowly I became a shell of my former self. I had intended on pursuing fertility treatments in 2019. But my mind and body were just too frail. My mind and body were just too frail to support a pregnancy. It wasn't until the series ended in December when James Charles and I met that I started to realize what had actually happened. Over the next few months, a few people have bravely come forward with more information. And the pieces of what we believe actually happened are coming together. Make no mistake. This is far from over. I've been terrified for a very long time, so much so that I had to relocate again two months ago. And I have taken serious security precautions to ensure my safety. On the advice of my attorneys, I cannot share with all of you right now the evidence that we have accumulated of the events that have occurred. However, there will soon come a day where we will be able to present this evidence. And you will be able to see why it is we believe that Jeffrey and Shane are responsible for so much of the damage that has been caused. I can tell you this. It's now my opinion that Jeffrey and Shane were both bitterly jealous of James Charles' success. Jeffrey resented that so much of his business was centered around his biggest rival and Shane did not like that James Charles wanted to make a documentary. Neither of them were happy with standing in his shadow on YouTube anymore. I believe James Charles was gaining more followers and receiving more views and more press faster than anyone in the history on the platform. And it's also my opinion that Jeffrey and Shane needed James marginalized and out of the way for their November launch of the conspiracy palette along with Shane's merch. I've also recently been informed that Jeffrey is allegedly a co-owner of Morphe. Before the scandal occurred, it also been told that James Charles was about to develop an entire cosmetic line with the owners of Morphe. This entire situation opens up a Pandora's box of speculation. But I'm just not sure anyone counted on this drama spreading like wildfire. It's my opinion that everyone involved got scared and their plan changed multiple times as I refused to play along or engage with the drama over the next several months. A year later, it is now my opinion that James Charles was not their only intended target. I believe that there are many different people who have unclean hands in all of this. And there was a coordinated plan to keep me quiet and push me out of the way for other business reasons. I do not think it's a coincidence that Morphe is about to launch their own brand of hair skin nail gummy vitamins. I do not think it was just Shane and Jeffrey that stood to benefit from my being silenced. This was just too big. I think there were many players. And I have every intention of getting to the truth. An early May when Jeffrey went on a podcast and denied responsibility for his involvement and placed blame on me, it was both cowardly and defamatory. Last week when Shane issued his statements about his involvement in all of this, I also perceived them as cowardly and defamatory. As for everyone else involved that did anything underhanded or defamatory over the last year, I am still well within the statute of limitations for bringing a civil action to seek recovery for my damages. Should I proceed with this course of actions? My attorneys will be deposing all witnesses who have information about the truth of what happened here. I hope for everyone else whose hands are dirty that have not yet come forward. Be careful of your legions. You don't want to be on the wrong side of the truth. I'm sorry I was unable to provide you with receipts that I'm sure you want. I've told you everything that I can right now. The remainder will be handled privately or at a time that I choose to speak publicly on it again. To the incredible people who watch my videos because they love makeup as much as I do. I'm so sorry that this situation cost so much pain and frustration and I truly miss you all. And I'm working really hard to heal myself. To become strong again. So that I can come back to this platform that I hold so dear. Doing a really terrible job. Not crying dad, I'm sorry. I just want to get my life back. And I don't want to feel like this. For what? In the description below this video, you're going to find a link where you can learn more about the Spirit Awakening Foundation that was founded by one of my biggest heroes and spiritual advisors, a co-eogram. Like public, thank you to you because this woman helped me so much. She has this grace and love where even just one conversation just really challenges you to look at things through the scope of love and of only rehabilitating and of only loving through it. And I'm grateful for the powerful women in my life that call to love and that call to everything light and healing. And I'm just I'm so grateful for her and her work that she is doing to really bring effective healing is important. It's an unusual type of work. And I have spoken before for voices of the unheard where you're giving voice to those who have been silenced. And I just want to take this time and like shine a little light on something good. And I've been supporting this amazing foundation for most of my adult life. They help kids that grew up in tough situations to reach their dreams and to change their lives. All of my ad sense from this video will be donated to the Spirit Awakening and earmarked for their spirit home project that will construct a safe place for those kids to come, seek guidance and betterment after their release from juvenile food. I appeal you to please take something from my hard lesson learned and be careful who you let influence your decisions. What you see in the media online and what you hear from friends is not always the truth. Do not allow yourself to be manipulated into doing harm in the name of justice. Try to seek peace. Try to find love. Try to hear others truth. People just want to be heard. So meet them with love and understanding. And I want you all to know that I love you and I love this career so much with the sun's going down. I'm going to go for now. Perfect time. The sun is setting. Thank you for listening and I hope this clears up enough for you to feel like you can forgive me because that's really important to me. And I'm still working on healing myself and I'm working through it. And just thank you. Even if the road stops here, I've had more good than that and I'm really, really grateful for that. And I promise to not cry during this video and I just cannot do it. It's been a lot of pain. I'm turning to God to get me through it. Where earlier in my life, I have to say I ran from God and I blamed him. I'm doing it different this time. I hope there's a small part of this that can help you to feel like you don't have to hate people. It does not fix anything. Even people that you want to cancel. Don't cancel them. Don't hate them. Don't spread hate. Really actually do that. Don't spread hate. You can turn away and give your time to yourself or to something else. You don't have to live there. You don't have to participate. It does nothing. I am praying for this pain to be healed and I just want you guys to know that I love you so much. I don't know when you'll see me again. Hopefully sooner than later, but thank you for hearing me out. And at some point I'll be back. And I hope that you will be back as well. All right. I love you all."
055_Jeff,"What's up everybody? Welcome back to my channel. Now I've been silent for a very long time. I know that's very rare for me. I've taken a lot of time to do a lot of self-reflection. Now in the past I've been very guilty of speaking out of anger, out of frustration, out of my emotions. I'm so quick to grab my phone and just say whatever is on my mind in that moment without ever really thinking the ramifications of my words, my actions, and for the first time in a very long time, I'm really reflecting on my behavior and my alone. I've come to a lot of realizations and it's been really important to actually understand everything that I was a part of that I did wrong and really start a new chapter for myself. I've spent a lot of time realizing why I do certain things and why I do the things that I do and today there are no excuses. A year ago I did a video called Never Doing This Again and I meant that and 2020 has been really, really crazy and I have added to the chaos. When I filmed my video called Never Doing Again, I meant every word in the video. Did I slip up? Am I human? Have I done some fucked up things? Of course I have. But at the end of the day, today, once again, I will not be exposing anyone. For everyone saying, Jeffrey's going to be coming with the receipts and we all need to be get ready to forgive. That is the opposite of who I am. I know I'm dramatic, I'm crazy at times, I'm outspoken, but at the end of the day, that is not who I am. And today I will not be sitting here showing a million text messages and all these things that allegedly are out there. That's not it. I will not be entertaining it. My lawyers are entertaining it behind the scenes, but I will not be. I know this may sound shocking coming from my mouth, but when you accept that you are the problem, you can become the solution. And I've definitely put myself in the victim mentality before when I knew I was wrong and maybe that maybe I didn't want to admit it, I wasn't ready to and I was too insecure. But today, there are no excuses. I'm someone that has impulse control and I'm fully admitting my flaws and I hope that people can learn from me. I have moments where I get fired up, I don't think things through. I don't think about how my actions will affect others while I'm saying them. And when you speak from your emotions without fully processing something, it is one of the most unhealthy things and that is a very major problem of mine. A lot of people want me to address this situation and a lot of people were putting a time stamp, like, Jeffrey, you need to speak on this right now. And I think that we live in a world where people are just so used to doing what people want right away and that's not good either. I think it's been very important to stay off of social media. I haven't been on in weeks. I've read anything, I haven't clicked a video, I haven't seen anything. And it's been really about finding myself again and remembering why I'm here and how my actions can affect other people and everyone around me. I know there's a lot of people waiting for me to address this situation. Now, I didn't try to take anyone down. I'm not a villain in a movie. This isn't a Netflix series with a crazy storyline. I know it sounds like it and trust me, I'm sure I'd watch it as well. But this is my real life and a lot of things that are happening and being said are false. When someone else tries to take someone else down or their career and it doesn't work, you can't just take a few more down with you. That's not how life works. We have to all take accountability for our own actions and no one else's and that's what I will continue to do. And if I don't, please fucking remind me. Now, I know that I've had a very hard time doing that in the past and that will not be happening again. Now, did I mix myself up in drama, did I speak on things I shouldn't have speak on? Of course I did. Did I believe certain things instead of asking the source, did I get caught up in the hype? Did I do dumb shit and did I not just simply call James Charles and ask questions myself 100% and that is my fault. I would like to personally apologize to James Charles for the words that I've said and for my actions. If I was really close with someone, I should have had the ability to just simply call them and ask and say, hey, these were the things that were being said to me. Instead, I didn't. I let people really gas me up, get me going behind the scenes and I really fell for a lot of things and I got caught up in the hype. It's disgusting, it's awful and none of it should have happened. So James, I'm truly sorry for my actions and my behavior. 2020 has been very tumultuous for a lot of us. It has been a very crazy year and I think that James and myself and anyone involved would agree with me that there are way bigger issues happening on this planet. I know that some people may, Jeffrey, you're just saying this as a distraction. Jeffrey, no, reality is here and makeup, drama and beauty, community, gossip and tea. It may be entertainment for you and it used to be for me but it's my life and it's their lives and right now outside of our walls our world is falling apart and it's truly shocking. So I'm not going to give you an expose of the beauty community, I'm not going to end anyone today. I've never blackmailed anyone in my life, I've never committed a crime before and I've never been to jail. It's been hard to process a lot of what is being said but involving the situation I would just like to say that James Charles, I'm very sorry. Anything else that you guys want to know it will never be spoken about. You can ask other people, I just like last year have fully removed myself and that I get swept up into the bullshit again of course I did and for that I'm forever embarrassed of. Now, Brianna Taylor still has no justice. Black trans women are being murdered every day in the news is silent. Elijah McClain has no justice and the countless other people who are murdered every single day while everyone just goes about their business like nothing's happening and I think that drama and the beauty world which I have definitely been a part of it all has to stop. Now, six months ago before COVID and everything hit our world it was such a different place for all of us and including myself it's really time to reflect on the big picture. Now Shane Dawson, he is one of my best friends and someone who helped me remember who I am when I was starting to crack and lose focus of who I really was. He's genuine, amazing, he's selfless and he is one of the most kind people that I've ever met in my entire world. I know that Shane would put his family and friends before himself in a flash. Now, it did Shane and I get caught up in the drama and do some dumb shit of course we did but that is my best friend and I was actually truly shocked that people thought that I was going to distance myself from him or that my silence was anything but support. I know Shane from now, I don't know Shane from 10 years ago and he doesn't know me from 10 years ago. Now, do I agree with Shane's past actions? Of course I don't and does he agree with bypassed behavior? Of course he doesn't. I know the amazing person that he is today and you don't abandon your friends. I know a lot of people have said, Jeffrey, you've had a lot of tumultuous friendships in the beauty world. Yes, I 100% have but in reality I have a lot of amazing real people behind the scenes and I'm forever grateful for those people who always remind me of who I am because lately I definitely was slipping. Now, what me and Shane accomplished together, business wise, I hope that inspires anyone out there that wants to start a business that is an entrepreneur or who is afraid to get off their feet because remember I used to be homeless and work at the mall and I really just said, you know what? I want to create my own vision and that's what I did and he has always believed in me. All right, now no matter what narrative anyone tries to spin of me, I am so fucking proud to own an inclusive makeup company. Since I opened my doors in 2014, I have created products for everyone. Any product, shade or formula I've created has worked for any race, gender and most importantly, I want you guys to remember that all beauty matters and from the very first ad of my company, I have always shown people of color and anyone, no matter what size your body are or what gender you are, you are accepted in Jeffrey star cosmetics. I know a lot of people try to deter from my message and sometimes I've deterred it myself through negativity and drama but that won't be happening anymore. I will always use my platform and my voice for good. Now, I remember when brands were making 10 concealers and 15 foundation shades and they thought that that was correct. I remember speaking up very loudly to my peers and other people in this industry saying that it was wrong and I got a lot of shit for it but I always took up for what's right and I always will. When huge corporations have stolen from small brands, I was the first one to speak up very loudly. Now sometimes it can be misconstrued for drama or tea or being sarcastic but the message was always that no, you have to do right in this industry and that's what I'll always stand by. Now, I just want to say thank you to everyone out there who has been supporting me, damning me, messaging me and just showing so much love. I know that sometimes it's not popular to be a fan of me, to be my friend but it has been so much for all the writer dies and the millions of people who have just been waiting for me to come back. Just know that it has been very important to actually self reflect and not just grab my phone and say whatever I'm feeling in that moment. This has been me silent for a reason. I've been really, really working on myself and I definitely was distracted. There's also been a lot of things going on in my personal life which will never be excuses and I'm not going to talk about them today but just know that we're all human beings and we're all going through a lot. What is next? You guys know, Jeffree Star Cosmetics will never be slowing down and I'm so excited for everything that is coming for the rest of 2020. I know that the Maker World is changing, the beauty community is shifting and COVID has transformed our entire world. But what's coming next is one of my most exciting projects ever and I can't wait. August is going to be very exciting. If you've made it this far, thank you so much for watching and listening to my words and thank you for allowing me to have time to articulate my thoughts and not just upload a video out of emotions. I will be back very soon with new videos, new makeup tutorials and of course new products. So thank you guys so much for watching this and I will see you soon. Bye guys."
056_Poki,"Hi everyone, I hope you're doing well. This video is to address recent comments and criticisms that I've received. I know this video is long overdue and I planned a vacation for around this time, but I honestly should not have taken any time off prior to acknowledging or addressing or apologizing for these things. Not only that, but I should have properly apologized when the incidents actually occurred. It shouldn't have taken me this long to come to a proper understanding of how to handle these situations and how to apologize for that. But I hope that I can do that today. So I have a list of topics I want to address and I'll go through them one by one. There are certain things that I want to give my perspective on and also some things that I need to apologize for. So I hope that you can watch the video in its entirety and form your own opinions. Firstly, there was an incident back at the end of 2018 where Mean Keemstar had an argument over Twitter. And a YouTuber by the name of Boblox took screenshots of these tweets and then uploaded them kind of as an archive on YouTube. And at the time, my MCN told me that because they are screenshots of my tweets that I can have the video taken down and Keemstar had deleted his tweets, I didn't want the drama to snowball into something more. And I honestly regretted even starting an argument in the first place. So I agreed and the video is taken down. This was my mistake because at the time I didn't consider the fairness of leaving that video up as well as not properly understanding the fair use defense when it comes to transformative content. So when this happened, Boblox was understandably upset. Once I saw his tweets and comments regarding the situation and how he felt, I messaged him privately and we tried to resolve things in DM. Later on, in January of 2019, other people had heard of the situation without knowing that I had approached Boblox privately and that we had spoken about it. So it became a much larger, more public issue. Pokemain. She strained this video called Keemstar vs Pokemain Twitter Fine. Someone decided to put these two videos together and upload it on YouTube. So basically this Twitter drama became an even bigger drama thanks to the YouTube algorithm. So in a way, I can understand why you want to take down this video. But the problem here is that you're just drawing more attention to it. And frankly, my apology at the time was not very good or was not good enough period. So I just want to reiterate that I'm sorry for taking down that video and since then I have not taken down any videos like that and I've genuinely tried to learn from my mistake. Alongside this, there's another incident that I frequently see people use clips of where I'm talking to someone about having their video removed. Anyways, I'll be taking down some of your videos. But yeah, I just hope you stop doing this. And I would just like to add in some additional context prior to discussing this situation. Pokemain pregnant. Do it, the section in the video. Pokemain twerk live on stream. So why do you do this? When you make these videos and you like talk about my butt or me being pregnant or whatever and you know it's like all fake or you know that you're trying to use... No, just a clickbait in the fucking title. Yeah, how does it like, why do you falsely clickbait? Yeah, this was disease clickbait bro. Do I sound mean? Yes, that's why I'm trying to talk to you. So as you can see, this person was re-uploading my content or my stream but then adding really inappropriate sexual, gross or just misleading titles. And I had some of these sorts of videos taken down back then but only because they were my content or my stream re-uploaded. Unfortunately, this has led to people assuming that I take down videos of people criticizing me. Behind the scenes, she actively tries to censor the internet. And by the internet, I mean anything negative about her. People made videos about her and she's copyright strike them. The list goes on and on. If you make a video that is negative about her, she's gonna try to gun you. Copyright claiming on YouTube is used as censorship. And for Pokemon, this seems to be the case a lot of the time. This is something that I've never done. If someone puts in the time and effort it takes to create a video where they're talking about me, regardless of how positive or negative it is or if they use clips of me, that is very clearly transformative content and I would never take down content like that. The other incidents were a bit more complicated because it was situations where people were re-uploading content of mine or something that I put out there. Regardless, I still handled those situations badly and I regret the way that I handled them and I'm sorry for the way that I handled them. But I just want to make it really clear that I fully support transformative content. It's an amazing creative outlet and allows people to make a living off the internet in the same way that I've been so lucky to do. My understanding of what should or shouldn't be taken down on YouTube two years ago was not well informed and I've tried really, really hard to learn from my mistakes and not make the same mistakes. And since then, I stopped allowing my MCN to take down videos on my behalf and the only exception nowadays is when, let's say for example, I do a cooking stream and I want to reupload that cooking stream on my YouTube because my stream is public and my vaults are public. People can also take that same content and reupload it at the same time. And with the YouTube algorithm, usually this means that one video is pushed and the other is kind of suppressed because they're the same piece of content. And one person, like an audience, will usually not watch both because they're the same thing. So only under those very specific and pretty rare circumstances am I kind of forced to take down the duplicate content of mine. But again, this doesn't all apply to if someone's talking about me or criticizing me. That is entirely their content I would never touch it. Sorry, this is a bit of a nuanced topic, but I hope I properly explain myself and added some transparency to the situation and if I have to clarify anything in the future, then I'll make sure to do that. Secondly, there was a recent incident where I was on stream and I watched a video made by It's a Gundam. And I made some remarks that I shouldn't have and that I'm very sorry for. And I'd like to provide context and then apologize for what I said. So the part of the video that I watched was him talking down on my fans and he was showing some tweets that were very clearly jokes but talking about them as if they're facts. I hope people know that tweets like this are a joke. In hindsight, I can totally understand how if someone was unsure if it's legitimacy, it could be pretty upsetting to see something like this. I also want to remind people that I or any streamer does not want you to donate if you can't afford it. Everyone should always take care of themselves and their family's first. And I try really hard to regularly say the same thing when I'm streaming as well. Back to the video, while he had this joke tweet pulled up, he also had a very real photo of a fan with me at a meet and greet and he was making fun of them and the way that they look. Here we have this gentleman right here. This guy is totally alpha. So this guy who looks like a Pixar animated character. Oh, a guy I love this guy's face. He's like a gnome dude. He doesn't even have wrists. Good lord. He can't wear a watch. And I've been mocked countless times for my appearance but I understand that's part of putting myself out there on the internet. It just felt so unfair to see that happen to an innocent fan who didn't write this tweet had nothing to do with the situation. And so in my opinion, just didn't deserve it. And I got really caught up in that feeling and I was so bothered and also bothered by people's potential perceptions when seeing this video. And I was admitted I reacted really poorly. This led me to making some comments questioning why the video was sponsored. But regardless of my opinion on the content, that's not okay. And all do better when sharing my concerns without having to comment on any part of the video that isn't the actual content of the video. I want to sincerely apologize to both it's a gunnam and to the sponsor of that video for the remarks and comments that I made. I completely understand people's concern for going after someone else's livelihood, especially in a time like this. And I wouldn't want to see that sort of thing happen to someone else. I also don't want to see that sort of thing become a larger tactic or trend on YouTube. So again, I'm very, very sorry. And I'll make sure that in the future, if I am to comment on any part of a video, it's just its actual contents, not the sponsors and also not to encourage my community or my viewers to leave any sort of negative feedback. I sometimes see a clip and a tweet circulating from the past where I've said the N word. I believe the tweet is from about five years ago and the clip from about seven years ago. And although I never said it with ill intent or racial context or the hard are, I still want to make it clear that I don't condone the use of that language. And I don't want my deletion of these things or my silence now to make it seem otherwise. I've commented on this in the past, but honestly, my statement or comments then weren't even good enough, even though people are very understanding. I just want to make it clear that I am genuinely so sorry if I hurt or offended anyone with what I said. I really wish I could go back in time and change the past. Unfortunately, I can't, but I do hope that my behavior in regards to language for the last couple of years and onwards will speak for itself. There are some final points I'd like to quickly touch on. Although they're not as important as the aforementioned things, they are just topics that have been frequently brought up and kind of intertwined with more important criticism. I've seen a lot of people talk about the way that I look recently. There's one to put it out there. I don't think I'm the prettiest person in the world, but I think that's okay. Everyone's entitled to an opinion. As an online personality or content creator, there's quite a lot of pressure to look perfect all the time. I feel like it's created a bit of a culture that is really detrimental to the self-esteem of honestly just about anyone that has social media. I don't at all regret the no-make-up streams or photos I've posted in the past. I want to make it really clear to anyone out there that it's okay not to look Instagram-ready all the time. And that you can be perfectly all right with both the version of you that's more glammed up and the way that you look on a bad day. Both versions of you are perfectly okay. I personally made the decision seven years ago or whenever I got into streaming that I don't want my personal life to be a part of my content. And in general relationship stuff is stuff that I don't like to talk about outright because even when I'm single, imagine how many people care and then if I got into a relationship, even more people would be invested in what is going on in my relationship. And if I had a relationship, I would want it to just be between me and that person and not a million people giving their unwanted opinion and advice and rum. And the thought of that just makes my brain move. And that's just what I'm going to stick by until I and whoever I'm dating at whatever time decide otherwise. For me, this also creates a healthier divide between my work life and my personal life, which is an area where the lines are already pretty blurred. I understand some people want to relate this to donations, but you could also argue that one can make a lot of money by publicizing the relationship or making content out of it. And neither of these things are wrong at all. I'm happy for others, whatever lifestyle they choose. I just personally feel like everyone has a right to privacy. I personally want to be able to experience my relationships without the scrutiny of an online audience. And if you disagree, that's totally alright. You don't have to support me or my content. React content is very popular both on Twitch and on YouTube. Whether it's good content, bad content, transformative or lazy is understandably up for debate. I can't say with certainty one way or the other. All I can say is that I do my best to engage with whatever content is on my stream. And honestly, oftentimes, the point of annoying my viewers. Anyways, back to the video. Oh, yeah, what I was going to say and it's not the first time that people have said mom, I saw. Oh my god, that reminds me of some. He thinks his friend dies. We are tracer games. Again, read positive and be read. Some days it's just nice to have a chill relaxing stream with your chat. Oftentimes I'm recording with offline TV or other collapse or other influencers. And so being able to do that is a nice balance and content or a nice break per se. After the copyright controversy, I've been especially cautious of this. The only content I ever leave up on my stream if I'm not actively present and engaging with it is either my videos or offline TV videos. To end things off, again, I'm really sorry that this video is late. Despite my planned break, I should have addressed these things sooner or I should have addressed these things as the incidents individually occurred or better yet. The incidents shouldn't have occurred in the first place. I need to be better in facing things head on and just doing better in general. There was a lot of guilt during my time off and it helped me better reflect on things. I have of course responsibility to myself to take care of my mental health, but I also have responsibility to all of you to improve and to just be a better example. So overall, I really do feel like I let some things get to me that I shouldn't have. And I hope that moving forward, I can just be appreciative of the amazing community I have and the platforms that I have. And I also want to add that I know criticism is bound to come in many different ways. I just really want to thank anybody that discussed any of these topics in a constructive manner. Reading your comments or thoughts genuinely helped me better understand my wrong doings, as well as just further my perspective. So thank you, thank you for listening. I hope I can do and be better for you all. Have a good day. Bye. Bye."
057_Albert," Hey, it's been a while. For those of you who don't know why, then gone. Yep, I fucked up. Okay, that's an understatement. I really fucked up. While I'm not famous by any stretch of the imagination, last year was the first time I could support myself as a content creator, largely thanks to my friends and peers who believed in me enough to promote me on their platforms. But I was weak. I let my physical and mental health fall to the way aside as my work became increasingly mixed with my personal life. Eventually, I failed to balance it all and ended up making some inexcusably terrible choices that cost me my career, my community, and many of the people closest to me. In short, I got canceled, and I'm sure many of you want the details, the play by play. The internet is always hungry for drama, but if you're here for the tea, you're in the wrong place. What transpired was an intensely personal matter that has taken substantial time for all parties to heal, and it's not my place to reopen old rooms to satisfy your curiosity. The intent of this video is actually quite selfish. It's a video for myself, a perpetual reminder of the hurt I've caused, but the mistakes aren't what ultimately define you. It's what you do after you make them. In the last year, I've been off social media, living alone, not as a streamer, not as a YouTuber, just me, Albert. At first, all I felt was intense, remorse, and pain. It's easy to let people define who you are, especially when thousands of them are telling you your sociopathic scum of the earth, piece of shit, whose very existence is a waste of space, and these feelings of self-loathing and humiliation seeped into all my social interactions. I was too ashamed to reject my friends and family, afraid that they might reject me or worse, receive flak by showing me compassion. So I socially disincented myself long before it was necessary, and tried to escape reality through whatever means possible. I started sleeping eight hours a day, I ate like there was no tomorrow. I binge-watch TV shows and no life video games, but no matter what I tried, I felt no happiness. It was then I understood, without my career, and people I cared about in my life, I didn't know how to be happy alone. How did it become like this? When I was seven, my first generation Asian parents had an unbelievably original idea. Television should try the violin. They baited me in by turning practicing into a game. For every half hour I'd practice, they'd give me a sticker, and being the gamer that I was, you can bet I farmed those damn stickers. But to my horror, I began genuinely liking the violin. You've now asked my parents to weaned me off the stickers, I continue to practice. Long and Dad couldn't be happier. Asian parents love flexing their kids' talents like holographic yugio cards, and lucky for them, I needed no convincing to perform. I would bust out my violin and play for anyone who listened, and yeah, I was bad. Really bad, but I didn't care. Seeing people smile and applaud made me happy. Made me want to play more. The same passion I had for the violin trickled into my other hobbies, such as Lego building, magic, and filmmaking. I just love learning new things and sharing that love with other people. Sadly, these feelings change when I turn my hobbies into my job. They say if you do what you love, you'll never work a day in your life. Fuck that noise. When you do what you love, your life becomes your work. You can never clock out. You're constantly thinking and working to deliver the best experience to your audience. For me, I was always looking for ways to optimize my videos, my music, my social reach, my skills, my happiness was not a priority. So I hated it, but at some point my passions stopped bringing me joy. There were commodities I packaged and sold in return for self-allocation and money. It became more about doing things I thought would be received well, rather than what I wanted to do. And socializing was the only thing that could pull me from my work. To my experiences, I'm actually an extrovert. I'm happiest when I'm spending time with the people I love and doing things to make them happy. However, I was people pleasing to a fault. I could never say no. Hey, Albert, can you help me film this video? Hey, Albert, can you make dinner tonight? Hey, Albert, can you cut your hand off from me? I value the happiness and approval of my peers, friends, and loved ones far above my own. So I'd often squash my needs in order to meet the needs of others. If it made them like me more, well, that was enough for me. It took being canceled for me to realize I didn't make myself happy. I always derived my happiness externally, whether it was from my career or my close relationships and not always in healthy ways. And having lost both, I had hit rock bottom. I took a good look at myself and asked, do you want to come back? You've heard people, you've burned bridges. Did you even really enjoy content creation your grateful fuck? Maybe it's time to try and just really not work. And I thought about it. Why I got into it in the first place. Was it because of the fame? The promise of fortune? No, it was something else. I fell into spark, who kindled inside of me. I remember the kid who loved the violin. The kid who was able to make others happy with this music, even though he sucked, because it was clear he enjoyed what he was doing. I remember that all I've ever wanted to do is learn and make cool shit that I like, with people that I like, and share that to the world. Because in many ways, I'm in hardest. Not a great one, and maybe never will be. And I'm okay with that. So my answer. But I knew if I jumped back into content creation right away, then nothing's really changed. So as cliche as it sounds, I've begun working on myself. I started small, finding things to do solely for my own sake, and not anyone else's. I learned to make my own coffee. Now, not your basic-ass Starbucks monstrosities, or shitty instant boulders, but homemade, pour over coffee. You may seem like work having to grind your own beans, weigh them, heat water to a specific temperature, and then pour the steady rate over a designated period of time. But for me, this was empowering. I had lost control of my life, so making coffee was a step in regaining that control. I also started exercising consistently. Redded armchair experts will tell you to hit the gym if you're depressed, but I shit you not, it works. While I was still paranoid about being recognized in the public, at the gym no one gives a fuck who you are. Everyone's just concerned about achieving one thing. Game. And I needed that. A goal that whether I reach it is entirely up to me. And I found working out gave me confidence, which in turn made me feel happier. And with this newfound energy I wanted something to direct it towards. I began looking into adopting a dog. So many cute dogs. But right before going to the shelter, my landlord shadowed my dreams of becoming a dog owner. And I had no pets. And also get rid of your shit in the living room. Disappointed but not discouraged, I went with the next best thing. Eased. I raised my yeast starter from scratch. All it took was flour, water, and seven straight days of feeding. And yeast boy was born. I take him on long walks, give him warm baths, watch TV shows together. He's perfect. Plus, I can eat him. You'd be hard pressed to find a bond that rivals that a man in yeast working together to create a delicious sourdough bread to feel the gaping voice stemming from my lack of friendship and social interactions in my day to day life. But I've been working on that too. I started seeing a therapist which has honestly helped me better understand myself. I've never shared so much and cried so much in front of someone I hardly know. I started making new friends who shared the same hobbies as me. Their passion for their crafts helped me invigorate my own. I also reconnected with old friends. The ones who are there for you no matter what. The ones I took for granted and I'm forever grateful for having met. And finally, I stopped ghosting my family all the time and started checking in more often. They've always given me the support when I fucked up and this time was no exception. And I know now, life's too short not to appreciate and spend time with those who love you. You never know when you might be seeing them for the last time. Recently my grandmother passed away. I loved my night and night. She was one of my biggest fans although she didn't really understand what I did for a living. When times were tough, she would always ask me if I was taking care of myself, making me home-cooked meals and sending me money whenever she could. It pained me to know that I worried her because I knew just how much she loved me. So I never told her what happened. We knew she only had a few months left to live and I didn't want to burden her with that knowledge. She passed away peacefully, believing that I was the successful and virtuous man I simply was not. But you can bet I'm working my ass off to prove her right one day. As of this year, I'm doing my best to lead an honest life, owning everything I've ever done, the good and the bad. With fear and violence running rampant in the world right now, I've become more cognizant of my privileges. I started several creative projects I'm truly passionate about and I've been learning to live for myself so that I can be a more present, empathetic and loving human being to those around me. And I know being canceled doesn't magically make you a better person. In fact, most people believe a canceled person will never change, but change doesn't just happen overnight. It's a lifelong process and I don't know if the people I've hurt will ever accept my apologies. All I can do is work towards the day when I'll be able to forgive myself. So when you search my name in the future, may the person you find... be the person I resolve to become."
058_Dalek,"Black Ops Cold War is releasing worldwide tonight. But before we can jump into the Easter Egg hunt tomorrow, I owe you all an explanation addressing a story that's circulating surrounding me. A few weeks ago, I uploaded a YouTube video explaining the Black Ops storyline. When researching for this video, I came across a smaller YouTuber called Suggestive Gaming, who created a very similar storyline idea and I thought it was brilliant. He explained the game's really well and I really enjoyed his video style. The relevance of this is I used his scripts and very similar visuals in my video when explaining Call of Duty World at War, Black Ops 1 and Black Ops 3. These exclamation were copied word for word from his video and whilst I did credit him in the description, this is nowhere near enough to justify the blatant plagiarism since I was not given permission to use his script or to use his visual style. There is no excuse for this behaviour and I'm deeply regretting ever considering what I did. With the platform I have, I should be setting an example for smaller crates to follow and this is not the example to set whatsoever. I've already apologized to him privately and publicly on Twitter but I know it is not enough without addressing it on the platform that the issue first began from. My apology did not explain what I did nor address what I'm going to do to rectify it. I want to say to suggestive gaming and to everyone watching who feels let down by my actions, I am truly sorry. Knowing I've disappointed so many of you brings me a great deal of regret. Furthermore, I want to extend this apology to anyone who feels I've overstepped the mark and used their content in a plagiaristic manner or without permission over the years. This is truly served as a moment for reconsideration. Over the last 24 hours I've been reflecting on what has happened and I really want to try rectify my wrong doings and going forward on improving so that this never happens again. I offered to give suggestive gaming all the ad revenue that the video made but he declined. As a starting point to try and apologise for everyone that's been affected, I'm going to donate the entire video's ad revenue which is roughly around $400 to a charity called Special Effect. Furthermore, I'm donating a further $600 to Special Effect. On behalf of all the content creators in the past, I've upset by posting videos that could be considered plagiarising their ideas. Going forward, I promise to do better. I've severely let you all and myself down and I do not blame you if you don't want to support my content anymore. I've been as open and honest about the situation as possible to you all and opening up about it on YouTube rather than explaining it on social media and I can only hope that you will accept my apology in time. If you do want to go and check suggestive gaming's original video, I've got it linked in this video's description. Everyone makes mistakes and we are all human at the end of the day. Thank you for watching."
059_GabiDe," This video was gonna touch on a very serious topic, so I'd like to insert a trigger warning. Recently, my lack of judgment and poor decisions have led to a very, very serious issue that needs to be addressed. I owe it to you guys. As I was coming up with new ideas and new content, I was watching a home video with my family of myself as a three-year-old when my mom announced that she was pregnant with my younger brother. In that home video, I ruined a beautiful moment by telling everyone that I heard my nanny tell me to put my panties on through a stethoscope. It's a video that has brought back laughter and joy within my family for years, and I shared it with what I thought was a funny caption. It's not funny. It was a quote from the video. Never in a million years did I think something that I thought was so innocent could be looked in such an ugly way, and I think that's where the problem lies. I've realized I'm so disattached with reality that it didn't even cross my mind that this could be viewed like this, and that's a serious issue. It's not funny. It will never be funny, and it's not okay. And I'm really sorry. I'm sorry to my friends, my fans, my family, to anyone that I've heard. I'm so truly sorry, and it was definitely a huge lack of my character and my judgment, and I know who I am in my heart, and I know that if you know me, you would know I would never condone anything like this. So it really hurts to know the pain that I've caused for so many people, my family, my friends, my fans, my supporters, even people who have just simply been triggered by my stupid thoughtless action. To everyone, I'm very, very sorry. It was very insensitive and a poor representation of who I am and what I believe in. I would never do anything to exploit or harm a child. I'm so sorry. Truly. Very sorry. This is a huge wake-up call. I'm gonna step back into reality now, and I'm gonna reflect, and I love you guys, and I'm so sorry. I'm going to grow and learn from this, and I will come out of this a better person, and I will do better. This was really wrong."
060_Pyro,"I'm gonna use this video to address the allegations made against me. Recently to those who were unaware, I've been accused of grooming a 15-year-old boy when I was 19. That I'm some kind of predator, and was aware of his age all along. This is categorically untrue and a complete lie. The supposed proof for these insane allegations is paper-thin and embarrassingly wrong. I originally made a response on my subreddit, and I truly believe the evidence I provided was enough, and for a time it was. But a few days ago, a poorly written Google Doc is surfaced, claiming that I have lied in my response, and I'm a 100% guilty. I just want to be clear, I have never lied at any point. This document is disingenuous, manipulative, and it fails to include so much of my original statement. Bringing new information to light, but also making points to prove my guilt, that I already proven to be untrue in my first statement. It's managed to fool so many people, like I see video after video of people now saying, that I'm a liar. And he claims here that Pyro could have actually been lying in his response here. They already kind of have this notion that he did it, and he's not responding, so it looks pretty guilty on his part to a lot of people too. Now this is the main part of the Google Doc that really set me off. I believe this piece of evidence is enough to say Pyro is in the wrong. Whether Pyro does respond to everything, or just pulls a mini-lad and ignores it for as long as he can, is still up in the air. This document makes like insane assumptions based on limited and broken evidence. It's not hard to dismantle it. It's just annoying that I have to be the one to do it. For those who haven't read the entirety of my original response, let me give a little background. When I was 19 and 20, I like to take part in this degenerate furry role play with pretty much anyone that would reciprocate. And looking back on it now, the word cringe, that doesn't near do enough justice to how sad this all was. These conversations never led to any new to being exchanged. It was just purely fantasy garbage, something which Ivory himself confirms. Did he ever ask you for a new to? No. No. What these people look like, they gender, these weren't variables. Like I could have been doing this with a 90 year old cave troll, and it wouldn't have made a difference. It was role play after all. You're just pretending. Now it turns out my accuser, Ivory, one of the people that I've had these conversations with was 15. That's three to four years younger than I was. It was entirely my responsibility to verify his age before having these conversations. And the fact that I didn't, that is so incredibly negligent of me to do so. I may have been young myself, but still old enough to know better. But let me be very clear. I had absolutely no idea that he was 15. I absolutely did not lie in my original Reddit post, and I would like to emphasise that. Ivory himself did not disclose to me directly that he was 15. And the evidence itself supports this too. I've been till September this year. I'd be perfectly cool with him. We were still speaking, and still on very good terms. However, for one reason or another, he felt the need to come out about these allegations. To expose that I'm a sexual predator, I took advantage of him, and I knew his age all along. This is all untrue, and I am amazed how out of proportion this is all blown up. Several of our conversations were leaked online by Ivory. Here's one of the more errrr... damning ones. I'd love for my sonar to be looking at his fat. Sweaty ass while rubbing his belly from behind, and then just having him gas all over my sonar's face. That would be so nice. Or if mine was just underneath him, getting railed underneath his huge belly, and your sonar could be gassing non-stop as he fucks mine like... Huh? Well, to be honest, I'd pick you up. Hug you while... ...to be honest, I'd pick you up. Hug you while rubbing you against my huge, sweaty moobs, then kiss your cheeks, telling you how much I love you, and then kiss you on the lips, and let out a hard, long belch into your mouth. Come on. Literally deviant art here. Oh my god. He's provided a lot of proof like this to show how much of a degenerate I was, and I mean, I agree, you know, you've got me. Now, the whole world pretty much knows what I jerk off to, but what he and no one else has done is come close to substantiating how this constitutes as grooming. I've read himself even struggles to explain how what I did was grooming. Um, how were you groomed? Because you don't need to be groomed for this to be wrong. Is it really fair that you use the word grooming? And if you, if that's true, if you feel that's true, where was this going? I see, I'm not like... I don't know. I was in a call with my friend when I typed it out, and I typed her, remember I typed that and asked, like, is that okay? Because it reads more like in YouTube, like thumbnail. Do you honestly believe? Did you not understand the definition of the word? I feel like it was like forcing a, or like manipulating a child into a, like, sexual situation. Okay. Yeah, that's what, that's what that word means to me. To disprove this, I'd actually have to see something to disprove, but there's, there's literally nothing. It's a blanket statement of, paracinical groomed me. The only thing I can possibly think of is inviting him and a bunch of other people to an event in the UK. And somehow, this got spun as me buying him a plane ticket to fly him out to have sex with him. Even even if he lied, which can't be proven, a 20-year-old guy flying a 16-year-old boy out to fuck him in England. I'm carried the lies. Most people find that disgusting, and that's why Pirates are losing. Uh, sov PewDiePie's editor is one of the many people I invited to this event, and he agrees the claim is just complete bullshit. I never thought in my life I'd have to ever justify something like this, but I do remember back in 2017, Nalt invited me and a bunch of other people to drink with him. And I remember telling Nalt very last minute that I couldn't come, so I pretty much flaked on him. To say something sexual was gonna happen in a very public event with a load of people, even people Nalt didn't even know, and wasn't really close with, it's just false, seriously. There's just no question about that. I really don't understand how you can reach the conclusion that I invited him just to have sex with him. I invited him casually. No plane ticket was purchased. No specific hand made invite was sent. It was flippant, non-shelon, and that exact same invite was copied and pasted word for word to dozens of people. Ivory himself even said he did not get any sexual tones from this. And when he invited you, was there any kind of indication that it was sort of a date in any way? I think there would be a wink wink date like a sexual interaction. Did he give you that idea at all? He didn't like, if he was, I didn't pick up on it. I mean, yeah, we shared some fat theory art. We had some weird fantasy role play, but there was no sexual interest. There were no no nudes exchanged, his name, his appearance. It wasn't important to me. I didn't even know what he looked like at this point. I mean, if he linked me a picture or something, I would have forgotten it because it was just that irrelevant to me. But I'm going to jump right ahead anyway and invite him to come over just for sex. Okay. Now this document, it tries really, really hard to prove that I knew Ivory's age, despite the fact that they have nothing concrete. Parasynical never saw any of the tweets of Ivory explicitly saying that he was 15 years old on an account paracynical follow and interacted with regularly. They then provide a list of Ivory stating his age multiple times on Twitter. So if I'm so sure that I didn't know he was 15, how would I have missed this? This is something I said in my original Reddit statement. He never once disclosed the fact that he was 15 at the time his exchange is commenced. He didn't include his age in his bio until he was 16, but I was not on Twitter between the 28th of December 2016 until the 29th of June 2017, as I was suspended. It would have been a hell of a lot less likely for me to see all, but one of these tweets had been used as evidence in this Google duck. My Reddit post clearly shows that I was suspended from Twitter at the time that they were made, and that of course leaves the very last one, but like what are the chances of you catching one specific tweet when you follow hundreds of people? I bought this up in my Reddit post as well, but it's been deliberately left out as some like shit attempt at manipulation. I find it funny like they're acting like I'm hiding something when ironically that's exactly what they're doing here. Literally all they needed to do was read my Reddit post. It's not even that long, man. It's a page. The next two points the duck makes are so interchangeable. I'm just going to tackle both at once. Pyrrassinical never saw the initial DM from Ivory saying he was a minor. Pyrrassinical never saw the DM where Ivory sent him his Twitter profile, clearly stating his age. The next part really confuses me because now the claim is because he linked his Twitter, which had his age in his bio, I now retroactively know that when this message or that message was sent, I knew he was 15. What? When Ivory linked me his Twitter profile, the age in bio says 16. This is something I acknowledged in my Reddit post, but to be fair, I probably didn't elaborate enough on it. In retrospect, I never should have continued the furry stuff with him once I learned of his age, even though at the time I didn't see it as a problem. Legally, age of consent is 16 in both my country and his state. I didn't consider the age gap significant enough because what we were talking about and doing was so far removed from actual sex. It literally was just fantasy furry garbage because I didn't consider Ivory sexual in any way in person. I never had a plan to progress our friendship into something more and I never considered it an issue. I understand though that you know this is going to be one of those weird gray areas where people are going to agree or disagree. I think it's a combination of all of these variables coming together, which led me to believe at the time there was nothing wrong from a moral standpoint. As for the other message, I don't remember seeing this message, and I'm not sure why it's being used as proof that I knew he was 15 because if you compare the dates, this message was sent two months after he sent me his link with his age in bio. The last two points for this segment, I want to tackle both at once here as well. Parasynical, who at the time was expressing interest in Ivory and being in a relationship with him at the time, which was corroborated by parasynicals at the time soon to be girlfriend, still never knew Ivory's age. An age with Eda clearly acknowledged, and an age which she thought would not dissuade him from being in a relationship with Ivory. Somehow Ivory never mentioned his age, and no one else mentioned his age in the presence of parasynical outside of all these clear instances, even once. So here they're trying to make it seem impossible, I wouldn't have known his age, or had to do some kind of like insane mental gymnastics to never find out. But if you look at the DMs Ivory provided himself for this document, you can see that he's confiding with Eda about age being a problem. Keep in mind as well, I was not in a relationship with Eda until about mid-2019. This document claims it as soon to be, but like, it's a whole two years before we actually start dating. And two whole years before this conversation took place. I mean, we both talked before, but we weren't close. She had no reason to confide with me with someone else's private information. So back when Ivory opened up to Eda about something private, there is no guarantee that she would have came and told me, despite the fact that this document and videos based off this document claim it as concrete irrefutable proof. This right here tells me that the conversation is real, thus proving that Pyro didn't know of Eda's age. But the conversation was between Eda and Ivory, so you know, Eda may have not told Pyro. Yeah, that claims flat out-retarded. I mean, at this point, you're implying that Eda has some sort of secret vendetta to take down Pyro and purposefully withdrew this information in order to bring him down. Kind of fucking ridiculous, don't you think? Why would Eda think to tell me about a random conversation that she had with someone over two years ago? The messages from Ivory regarding a relationship were completely one-sided. If it helps for context, because we're being so open here, I'm straight, IRL, like I have no interest in guys. This is just purely like a weird fantasy, and it does not carry over into the real world whatsoever. But one thing there is no excuse about is Eda attacking Ivory in DMs once he posted about me. What she said is deplorable, and I don't agree with it at all. It did come from an emotional place, but that is not an excuse. Now, one where the document tries to criticise my initial statement is the fact that I used evidence that was later retracted. One of them was a Twitter thread of someone trying to prove that I was innocent, and someone else is an individual that Ivory had sent kinks stuff to. The thing is though, with this information retracted, my original statement isn't debunked. The document fixates on the specific fact that people with drew information, while ignoring so many points like what I mentioned earlier. On top of that as well, the person who made the thread defending me recently came out and said at no point that he actually apologise for making that thread, and his words have been twisted and put in this document to be used against him. The reason why I used these Twitter screenshots against him is the fact that I felt his accusations came from a place of dishonesty. We spoke casually on and off until September of this year. I provided screenshots of our conversations that were posted in my Reddit statement. There was no bad blood, and then when other people came out on Twitter, saying that they also had dishonest experiences with him, I used that to further my own belief that these accusations were made for the sake of it. Me, including the anecdote evidence, led to the belief that Ivory lied about his age, that is never a claim I have made that he has done to me. I've only said that I did not know his age at 15, which in turn has caused more people to believe that I lied in my original statement. I just want to say though, this is not an excuse, it is entirely my responsibility to verify age. But this never escalated from two morons talking about inhaling very farce, and I never intended it to. There go, grooming. There's a message that was used of me basically having a breakdown that was put in Ivory's original post, saying pretty much how everyone's going to find out, and how to keep looking over my shoulder, like my paranoia was through the roof. And this has been twisted, of course, to make it seem that I am guilty for grooming a 15-year-old. I think it's quite obvious what, like, I'm actually worried about. I didn't want the public to find out that I was a complete degenerate, and into this like, furry roleplay shit, and anyone would be embarrassed by that. I haven't had any conversations remotely resembling this for the past three years. But of course, I still did, and still kind of do hate myself for it. That being said, over the last couple of weeks, I've learned to embrace it, because that's all I can do now. Now, this is a good time, actually, to discuss a discord conversation that was leaked, where I'm asking someone for a way to, like, mass-delete discord messages. Very obvious explanation. I was shit-scared of the public finding out that I was a complete degenerate, and, you know, pretty much just being kinkshamed for all eternity. But this has now been twisted into, like, me trying to hide evidence of grooming to escape internet justice. They're trying to make it out to be far more insidious than it actually is, and it's sick. People seem to be choosing, like, what part of my statement to run with, instead of acknowledging all of it. They twist what they want to twist, misinterpret what they want to misinterpret, and then they just ignore the rest. I'm just, again, amazed how people read this document, and just believed it at face value. The problem is, I have with this drama, that there is no middle ground. Originally, Ivory was labeled as a manipulative cloud chaser that could do no wrong, because people chose to believe my screenshots over his. And you turn out to be while a lot of people were calling you from the start. A cloud chaser trying to ruin some's career on YouTube, but alone on the internet for attention. But now those same people are saying I'm guilty, because they read this document, and didn't bother to cross-reference it with my original statement. Not only is there proof of Hyro knowing that Ivory was underage, but definitive proof that the messages were real, along with other damning evidence too. And also, these are the same people that say, I shouldn't take my time with this response. It's gone too far and too much has come out for him to take us time with it, like he did with his last response. There needs to be a middle ground. I did fuck up. There is no excuse, and I am sorry for that. But I am not a groomer or a predator. And documents like these only try to show one side, and build a narrative that I'm a liar, when I have never actually changed my story from my original post. My mistake, if anything, was not being clearer. I have never tried to hide anything. This document has managed to fool so many people, like you've got this person that came to my meet-and-greets, and they're dressed up as my character. The effort they went to was insane. But thanks to this document, they've recently came out, claiming that I was only nice to them, because I had an ulterior motive. The document also toggles a tweet Ivory made, where he says he hates me, and I'm a leech. This was a copypasta, and it was so easy to disprove. The majority of people found out, as soon as you like, copypasted the actual tweet into the search bar. I didn't even think to mention this in my original statement, because it was totally beside the point. I think it was included here, as a way to make Ivory's claim seem more genuine, without having to do any actual work. Why would you try so hard to debunk a claim 20 people complained about on Twitter? But yet, ignore the fact that I provided exact dates of my Twitter suspension. Another argument, paracenical made, lies in the idea that Ivory messages other people of similar age around the same time. They then show a screenshot that I posted of Ivory talking about the cringey fairy stuff with someone else. Ivory then posted the rest of the conversation on Twitter, and it really doesn't change the narrative much, apart from adding that he wants to be left alone. At the time, I felt it was more than fair that I show an example of Ivory having a similar conversation with someone else, and how he wasn't affected by it as he claims he was with me. He's still excused the guy. There was no call out post on him, and I think it was fair to question that, like why didn't he see a problem? Now, I understand I have a lot more reach and power a much larger platform, but this document goes as far as to compare me to legitimate predators, like Kiwis, someone who sent and received nudes to a 14-year-old girl lied about I ever happening, and then his excuse was, don't trust girls. People fuck up like teenagers. Teenagers are stupid, man, and I'm fucking, I fucked up being, you know, it was really irresponsible. I shouldn't have trusted this girl. I shouldn't have. They also post a screenshot of Eda saying that I did this with everyone. There's this one part of the duck that claims that people make the mistake of not watching an entire video before they pass judgment, and this is like bitterly ironic. You make that claim, but you leave so much out of my original statement. It's written with, like, such cruel intentions, and it waits until page 16 out of 19, only then to confirm that I never actually sent or received nudes. I like as well how they just hid it in the middle of that huge paragraph. It also tries to twist conversations like this one. You know, like claiming that this isn't part of the roleplay, but discussing the hypothetical of having sex with ivory. No context, no conversation before, no conversation after. You're just meant to interpret this as a 100% I wanted to have sex with him in person. This document probably never thought I'd actually respond to it piece by piece because, you know, the majority of the messages, they're so fucking bad to look at. This document is cowardly. I mean, like, the ending is no exception. Like, they don't even definitively stay if I groomed anyone. They just leave enough room for people to draw that conclusion themselves without openly saying it. Even if this was made in good faith, it is a severe case of tunnel vision trying to write a perceived wrong. But I can't just sit here, you know, and let my name get dragged through the mud. Unaside note, unrelated to this duck, I've actually seen screenshots circulating around of someone who drew, like, fan art of my fox character back in 2016. I then apparently replied to them, like, jokingly saying not thick enough and then asking for the rage, and they said 15. So when people saw this, they instantly drew parallels to the grooming allegation. I asked them for a thick version and they drew this, which isn't even really that different from previous things they drew before even getting into contact with me. I didn't commission it. What was drawn wasn't pornographic. They'd drawn very similar stuff before and that there was no roleplay here. It was nothing. And the thing is, this wasn't even a call outpost. The person that made the original video just said it was funny. So I'm gonna read the pyrosynical video now. This was in 2015. When this happened, I made that video over a year ago. It was not meant to be taken seriously at all. I'm also wearing the same outfit. It was just a funny story from high school to be completely honest. That's the only thing that I meant by it. I didn't mean it meant to be a call outpost. The video was not meant to be taken seriously. That being said, it was incredibly irresponsible of me and not my best look. But this isn't at all comparable to the current situation. Now, I do want to directly say something to Ivory and apologize to him and to anyone else that I did the furry roleplay garbage with. What seemed consensual and reciprocal may very well not have been. It's not my place to decide. It happened. It was my responsibility to verify age and I never did. And I am sorry for that. You shouldn't have been putting that situation and it was stupid of me to message people about this furry stuff without taking into account the influence especially considering how sexual the tone of these messages were. It wasn't until later where I decided this was an issue and decided to stop entirely. I hope you can understand the frustration in my original post but I shouldn't have attacked you. Only apologize and defended myself. Now, really good closing note here for anyone that is still confused to any degree. If your accusation is solely paracinacal is a complete degenerate and should have not had these conversations with someone that he didn't realise was 15. You win. I can't dispute that. But if you either insinuated, contributed or directly called me a pedophile who groomed someone knowing that they were 15 that is a completely false claim. I've said my piece, I've admitted false and apologized to the best of my ability. I just want to move on from this. I want it to end. Thank you for watching and hopefully this gives you a more widened view on the situation."
061_Ladd,"Hey guys, this video has been a long time coming and this is something that I've been wanting to talk about for a while but 2020 has been an awful year for everybody and I want to go into next year knowing that I have said my peace, I've told you guys exactly what's going on. As my fans you guys deserve to know what's going on and I hope this video helps you understand everything better and I want to apologize for the things that I've done. I'll try and make this video as short as I can so I don't keep you guys here too long. I don't want this video to be excused as an excuse or victimizing myself for anything like that. I just want to give you guys my thoughts. This is no more PR teams, no more anything like that. This is just Craig. This isn't many lad. This is Craig talking and I want to be as transparent as possible but I wanted to explain through exactly what happened. The reason why I did it and go from there. There was two people involved in the situation as to those names were Halle and Dash. I'll be taking them individually. They happened around the same time. I wanted to just go through it with you guys. The first person that I wanted to talk about was Halle. A lot of people think that these people were random fans that I got in contact with but both Halle and Dash, these are people who are my friends. Halle, I've known for a long time since maybe 2013, 2014. Halle was one of my Twitch mods. Halle was a really good Twitch mod. She helped me out. She helped terrorize her out. She helped a lot of the guys who I played with on our streams and she was someone that I could go to with my problems. We became close because we both had our issues. It's not my place to say what's going on with her but she's someone who has helped me out a lot. The first thing that I wanted to say was I added Halle on Snapchat when she was 16. This isn't when I was making any remarks towards her. This is just where I talked to all of my friends. I was that guy that had streaks and I wanted to make sure that our streaks were good because back in 2015, that's kind of what people did. It wasn't until 2016 when she was 17 that I first started to flirt with her. I was 21 at the time and that's not okay. I'm aware of that. So with Halle and both with Ash, I sent the messages around this time and I understand what I'm going to say next is quite taboo online but if this is my way of putting all my cards in the table and telling you guys what happened, I feel like I need to say it. The reason I did what I did and there is even a message where I said this is because what I said there is true. I did try to end my life at the beginning of 2017. I'm not looking for sympathy. I'm not looking for anything. This is not what this is about. This is telling you guys the reason and I just want you to understand the headspace that I was in. The reality is I was being selfish. I wasn't thinking about repercussions. I wasn't thinking about anything. I was just being stupid and I really want to apologize for that. I just wasn't thinking and I regret it. I have regretted it since and for that, for both Halle and Ash, I'm really sorry. Ash to me, I knew a lot shorter. I mainly have known her a few months. She was a part of a group of friends who my Twitch mods were friends with and that's how we became friends. This is someone who I became friends with just through association with my friends and the stuff I sent to her is just not okay either. That's not what I wanted. She was someone that really did call my friend and it sucks that I let her down like that. I also wanted to point out a message that I sent to Laura who was a part of my Discord mods. She's someone who I met a few years back, maybe 2016 and she was someone who I considered her friend as well. Whenever we went to Insomnia, we used to hang out and meet up with the booth that terrorizer and I had and I sent this message. Whenever I saw them coming out with my message, I sent them. I sent them this. This isn't me. That's not right. It's it's something that I completely regret. I panicked. I was scared. I didn't know what to do and I just I love my job so much that I didn't want it to go away and I just wasn't right. So to Halle and to Ash here at the end up and even to Laura for for bringing that up, I'm sorry guys. You were my friends. I failed you. I was only thinking to myself and I was being stupid and I wish I could take it all back but I also wanted to add in here that a lot of people think that I haven't apologized to these girls. I had to fight my PR team for this but in my initial apology on Twitter, I said that I would privately message an apology, separate apology to these women and that's what I did. My PR team said not to message them but these were my friends and I thought it was right that they deserved their own private apology and I'm not going to show the apology. I'm going to blur it out but I want to show that it's there. It wouldn't be a private apology if I told you guys what was in it. So I hope you can understand the privacy in that matter. I have no ill will against you guys. I want you guys to go out there and I want you to prosper and I want you to live up the exact life that you want to live. I want you to be happy because one thing I've learned over those last six months is I care about the happiness of my friends. I realize that I let you down and I hope that life is good to you from here on out. So my final thoughts just to wrap up what I've been doing the last six months and why it's taking me so long. Well the reason why it's taking me so long to make this video is I was scared pretty early on I wasn't okay. That's the reason why I went back to Northern Ireland not to flee charges but just to go back with my family. YouTube is my life. I've been doing it full time for seven, eight years now. I've been you know the Maylade channel is 10 years old next year and it's all I know it's what I love. It's my passion. It's it's what I wake up every day and I love to do and I realize over the last few even few years that I just haven't put the love and attention into it and you know what I want. I want I want it to be like a portfolio of the cool things that I've done and I want to rekindle myself. I want to find out who I am. Not many lad. Not anything like that. I want to find Craig. I've been in therapy the last six months and mentally I've been in there every week apart from a few weeks because of Thanksgiving and Christmas and everything like that. But and as much as I know that through this I've broke your guys' trust. I don't expect daffodils and rainbows after this. I wanted to be raw. I want you guys to build up trust in me over time and I want to be able to make videos that I'm proud of and I want to be able to be better and that's what I wanted to say. So thank you all so much for watching. They may be bits and pieces that I missed and for that I apologize. But I wanted to try and get everything in here. So this is all my cards on the table. This is me being as transparent as I can. I want to say thank you for watching and have a happy new year and I will see you all in 2021. Let's let's pray for a good 2021. So thank you guys. Bye."
062_Dobrik,"Hi guys, it's um, 145 in the morning and I'm finally by myself. Which I know doesn't sound that crazy to be by yourself. I'm 145 in the morning, but um, this week's been pretty hectic and there've been a lot of people. Um, a lot of people around tell me what to do, giving me advice, um, try and help me, um, most importantly. And, and that was a lot. And, and I, and now I, I, I, I, just want to, I want to be able to do this and just shoot straight into the camera and just talk to you guys. Um, I've put myself in a lot of situations where I need to apologize for my past actions and I've never done this correctly and I've never done this respectfully. And my last video is a testament to that. I, I don't want to defend that video. I don't want to delete that video. I just want to be clear. What this video isn't going to be is not going to be me describing Trisha, cat or any other woman involved. Um, I'm going to be using words that may trigger some survivors and that's just so I don't explain anything vaguely and I can explain every situation appropriately. I want to start this video off by saying I fully believe the woman who came out against Dom and said she was. As it was reported, the next day I got consent to post the video. Even though I got the consent to post that video, I should have never posted it. And I, what I understand now and I didn't understand before is that she sent that text because she felt like she had to not because she wanted to. And that's fucked up and I'm sorry. When she later reached out a couple months later, take the video down. I immediately took it down and I want to apologize to her and her friends for ever putting them in an environment that I enabled that made them feel like they're safety and values were compromised. I'm so sorry. I was completely disconnected from the fact that when people were invited to film videos with us, especially videos that relied on shock for views or whatever it was that I was creating an unfair power dynamic. I did not know this before. It was completely wrong and I wish I was more responsible and I wish I was more aware at the time and I'm so sorry I missed that. I didn't know what was going on in that room and I should have been. I should have been there and I should have been making sure that everybody involved was, was taking care of and wasn't uncomfortable. I don't want to use buzzwords to try to justify this or explain this but all I can say is people felt like they had to be silent for the sake of my video and that's not right and it's fucked up and I'm sorry. I also want to acknowledge the women that spoke out against Dom in 2018. I'm talking about Ali and then I'm talking about other girls that address their problems privately or publicly. I'm sorry I didn't listen to you guys. I am sorry that I that I took Dom's word for what happened. Those in those certain situations and I didn't believe you and not only did I not believe you but I made a joke of of what kind of a person Dom was because I couldn't wrap my head around a childhood friend of mine doing this to people and actually hurting people and and I'm sorry for that. Not only did I discredit you Ali but I platformed Dom and not only did I platformed Dom but I platformed the subject of sex in a negative way where I made jokes about it and I reinforced that kind of behavior and I'm so sorry and I really let not only you down but a lot of people down a lot of people that watch me and my friends and family for that. I made the decision to no longer film with Dom in 2019 and I'm not saying my content has been brilliant since then but that's when I first started taking into account the power dynamic and what influence I had on people that I was filming with. But what I didn't do is I didn't go back to any of these women and apologize. I kind of moved on and I learned from it and I grew from it but I didn't address the situation with these women. I'm not talking publicly I'm saying even privately I didn't reach out to any of these people and that breaks my heart knowing that I was doing all this stuff and I was making all this content while there was people that were still really hurt by what I made. Before my content shifted to be more responsible and positive I said and did things that were really offensive and I called them bad jokes and I can't even call them bad jokes and it was cowardly of me to say in my last apology that I missed the mark because it's fucking gross and I'm sorry. A lot of people reached out to me saying cancel culture is bullshit and you need to fight back and you need to call people out and I don't agree with how this should be taken at all and I think when there is a crisis there's a serious opportunity to correct yourself to learn and improve and to make sure those mistakes don't happen again and that's why it's so important to hold yourself accountable and I think with this situation there's a lot I can look at and there's a lot I can learn from but there's a lot of mistakes that I made and I'm sorry for that I'm sorry for everybody I've let down I'm sorry to my family and I'm sorry to my friends that I've embarrassed and this won't happen again. I'm going to take a short break from all the social media stuff because I realize there's a serious lack of infrastructure when I make any kind of content and I want to be able to have a place of checks and balances. I want to have HR and I want to be able to have people communicate, discomfort in a way that's that's comfortable to them and where they don't feel like they're emotions or what they're doing or how they're acting is compromised. It doesn't feel right to go back to posting like I have been and it also doesn't feel right to go dark because I love what I do but I think it is important to show that change is possible and that I'm learning maybe even forgiveness is possible. I want to use this opportunity to step up and own my mistakes and like I said before I've never done apology the right way and I'm sure I'm going to look back at this and I'm going to be pissed at some things that I didn't say or I wish I could have added more but this is this is my beginning to that and and I'm sorry for everybody that I hurt. I also want to add that I'm making myself available to anyone that wants to reach out that I've hurt in the past. I want to be able to to hear and understand from yourselves and I'll be reaching out on my own to some people because I still have a lot of learning to do and I think when you talked to other people, especially about experiences like this, it really helps you see things in a different way. But yeah, I'm sorry if this video was all over the place. I just wanted to sit and talk and ramble and I really truly hope that someone can take something away from this experience that another creator can take away from this and I know it feels I because I know how crazy it felt to me that there was some sort of toxicity or some sort of power dynamic in my friend group but really just take the moment, especially when creating content that you're trying to get viewership out of or you're trying to get laughs out of like really take a moment and and look at where the jokes and where the feelings begin because I think that's so incredibly important. Okay, I'll see you guys bye."
063_James,"Hello everyone, James Charles here and today I'm going to be making a very important video about a very important topic. As many of you guys know about two years ago now, I was involved with a very public online scandal in which some fellow YouTubers made some very serious accusations against me and within the past couple of weeks, similar accusations are being made again and I think it's very important that I get on camera and talk to you guys honestly about what is going on. When this first happened two years ago, I uploaded a video to my channel called No More Lies and that video was a very planned video. It focused on receipts and screenshots and defending myself in the situation but I want you guys to know that this video that I'm going to be making today is going to be nothing like No More Lies. This is not exactly planned, I don't have a script, I will let you guys know that I do have some notes in front of me of points that I want to make because this is a very serious topic but today's video is going to be from the heart and I'm going to focus on what happened, the conclusions that I've come to and most importantly holding myself accountable for my own actions. First and foremost, I need to say sorry, I owe a massive apology to anybody that I've hurt or anybody that I've made uncomfortable with my actions and I also want to say I'm sorry to my friends, family and fans that have to watch another one of these videos because you shouldn't have to and this is really, really embarrassing. When this all started online a few weeks ago, it sparked a large conversation and many people have shared their thoughts and opinions and I want to take some time to address literally everything in today's video but before doing that I want to make it really, really clear that I fully understand my actions and how they are wrong. There's no excuse for them and I don't plan on making any in this video either and I hope that you will choose to watch it all the way through. I also just want to make a quick note as well that I'm filming this on the night of March 31st, it is currently 12.54 in the morning. I'm alone here in the studio and I know that when I upload this tomorrow it is going to be April Fool's Day which is awful timing because this video in this topic is not a joke, it anyway shape or form and I don't want anybody to think that it is but I also don't want to wait any longer to speak about this. I want you guys to know that this is very, very important to me and I'm taking this very, very seriously. The last thing that I want to say before I just get into it is that I think it's important that I provide a trigger warning for this video. There's going to be topics and things talked about that are very, very sensitive to some people and I don't want anybody to have to listen to those if they don't want to. So I'm just letting you know right now but with all that said, I think it's time that we talk. In case anybody isn't aware of what's going on within the past couple of weeks, two different people both under the age of 18 have recently come forward saying that they had inappropriate messages on social media. One of them being from last year and one of them being from more recent. In both of these cases I added these people on Snapchat, asked how old they were right away, what souls that they were 18, believe them, engage in a 30 conversation and then later on found that they were actually 16. Upon finding out I was immediately embarrassed and blocked both people. Later on when I saw them making videos about it and those videos going viral, my immediate reaction completely honestly was to be really, really upset. I wanted to get on camera and film another No More Lies video where I gather all my receipts and all my screenshots and try to tell my side of the story and then just move on from the situation. And now looking back that was so stupid because as I did more research on these topics and self reflected, I realized that the receipts and the screenshots and the specific details of the interaction really don't matter because I fucked up and I needed to take accountability for my actions and most importantly apologize to the people that were affected by them. These conversations should have never happened point-blank period. There's no excuse for it, there's no if-answer buts and I take full responsibility for that. I trusted the information that was given to me rather than the information I could have and should have gotten myself. In both of these situations, doing research into these people as public social media profiles, whatever revealed their true ages and therefore these conversations would have never happened in the first place but I didn't do the research. And that is what is so embarrassing. As an adult it is my job and my responsibility to verify who I am talking to and therefore there is no one to blame for this other than myself. To the guys involved with the situation, I want to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I added you, I'm sorry that I flirted with you and I'm really sorry if I ever made you uncomfortable. It is completely unacceptable. I was being reckless and after looking back and finally realizing that this was my own fault, I started to do a lot of thinking and reflecting to really try and figure out why I was actually allowing myself to be so reckless in the first place. In all other areas of my life, my friends, my business, I like to think of myself as pretty put together on top of things and I couldn't understand why relationships were the one outlier, why were they not working, why was this area of me so different? And I finally, finally came to a conclusion. It's socks and it is ridiculously embarrassing to admit this but I think I have to and that is that I'm desperate. I do understand that with these videos coming to light, it's really starting to not even starting. It's really looking period like I'm actively searching for younger people to be in a relationship with and I just want to say firsthand that that is absolutely not the case. My hope has always been to be in a relationship with somebody around my age or older that I can relate to and that can make me laugh. And unfortunately, I've not been able to find that person yet but the idea of actually being in a relationship became so important to me that I was willing to trust too quickly, miss out on red flags and most importantly not take the precautionary measures that really anybody, but especially somebody with a public platform should be taking before talking to anybody and there's no excuse for that. When I've watched videos in the past of people talking about serious topics such as this one, it's always really bothered me when people would talk about conclusions or changes that they're going to make without actually talking about how they got there in the first place. So I think it's really important that I do that in this video. I just honestly think that I owe it to you guys to kind of walk you through their reflection that I've been doing. So you know that I'm taking this seriously, how I came to terms with my desperation and how it led me here. In 2019, my dating life became even more public than it already was when I was called out and labeled as a predator. You guys, I feel like at this point, I'll know the story so I don't want to go back into details but pretty much I had to get on camera and prove that I was being lied to. I had all the receipts to back it up but at the time I also recognized that I definitely needed to change the way I was going about dating because clearly something was not working. And in that video, I made a vow and a promise to myself and to you guys as the audience that I would be way more careful moving forward and that promise was not one that I kept. I'm going to be honest with you guys at the time that I posted no more lies. I really thought that like the only issue was kind of like the straight guys and being lied to. But I now realize that it was obviously a much deeper problem and I really wish that at that time I had spent the time to sit down and look at myself in the mirror and try to get to the root of the problem and understand why I was actually allowing myself to get into these situations instead of just brushing it off and saying like it's the straight guys and it's a lie. But like I said, I didn't and as time progressed, my desire for relationship never really went away and I slowly started ignoring red flags again and also ignoring my friends and the important people around me that warned me that I was going to get hurt and to them, I also feel like I really owe an apology because I should have listened and I feel like if I did, we probably wouldn't be here today. Looking back now and just trying to do my best to piece this all together in my head, I think that my lack of experience when it came to dating growing up and then all of a sudden having a lot of attention from different types of meds, some for good reasons and some for bad reasons really affected me in ways that I didn't quite understand. I honestly just thought that I had really, really bad luck and that I was being taken advantage of when that wasn't the case at all and I had the mentality that I could reach out to literally anybody and he's my explore page and for you page as a dating app and eventually I would just happen to find it the right person but that's just not how dating works literally at all. It's gross, it's weird and it's desperation. I just really thought it was important to share my thought process and the conversations that I've been having with myself and professionals behind the scenes in order to help myself fully understand the situation so I could properly hold myself accountable for how I got here in the first place. When these videos started to come to light, power imbalance became a really large topic of conversation on social media and rightfully so. In 2019 when I had my whole situation, I was accused of abusing my fame, money and power to get what I wanted and when I responded to that at the time, I said that that was disgusting and that I would never want to do that and to this day I still stand behind that sentiment 1,000%. So when it was getting brought up again, I got really, really frustrated and was trying to understand because I was thinking to myself like, okay, I know that this situation shouldn't have happened. I know that I, this conversation shouldn't have occurred. I take responsibility for that but at the same time, they DMed you first, they lied to you. They flirted first. You didn't use your fame, money, power to get anything. But I've now realized that mentality is completely raw because a power imbalance can happen even when it's not intentional. What I wasn't getting before is that the excitement that comes with talking to a celebrity is literally enough to make somebody do or say something that they normally wouldn't. Even if that celebrity isn't intentionally weaponizing their fame, money or power and that's the concept that I just wasn't getting, but I now do. Even though I'm able to turn off my social media and just talk to somebody outside of this spotlight about something normal in normal clothes and no makeup on as James Dickinson, that doesn't change the fact that to them, I'm still James Charles and that's something that I can't turn off. For me, having a public platform has become such a huge part of my life that at this point, it does feel normal, but I have to understand that to 99.9% of people, it's not normal and will never be normal. And that's where the power imbalance lies that I wasn't understanding. But I'm so glad that I finally do, because like I said in 2019, taking advantage of that power imbalance is something that I would never ever want to do but unintentionally was. With this situation blowing up, there are a lot of people speaking about this online, whether it be sharing their opinions, arguing back and forth, or most importantly holding me accountable for my actions. I understand that posting this video today is not going to stop those conversations, but it's going to spark more of them. And that's something that I am completely okay with because I really feel like these are topics that we need to be speaking about a lot more. I also want to make it clear too that through uploading this video today, my hope and my expectations are not to, you know, press post and then forget about it and move on and wash my hands as if nothing happened because something did happen. And what happened was not okay and I don't want to just forget about it. I should have been more careful in every single way when it comes to the ways that I was looking for relationship. I didn't do the proper research and for that, I'm once again ashamed and embarrassed. I can't take it back as much as I wish that I could, but I'm really, really glad that I now fully understand the situation. So I'm able to do better in the future and I really hope to show that to you guys. I'm a firm believer that when scandals or situations like this happen, you can get on camera and upload an apology video where you say sorry a million times all day long, but the only way to actually show and prove that you are sorry is through action and change. And I'm going to change this whole situation has been so embarrassing and I'm ashamed, but like I said, I'm now educated and fully understand what went on and I'm making a promise all of you right now on camera that I will be way more careful moving forward with every single person that I speak to my for you page next for page are not dating apps and I will stop treating them as if they are. I also have already started asking for proper identification from every single guy that is either reached out or that I was speaking to and will continue doing so for the rest of time. I now understand the root of the problem. I understand how and why I and only I cause myself to get into this situation. I understand that this could have and should have been easily avoided and I also understand that I need to be where my platform at all times. I didn't understand how a situation like this could affect the people involved, but now I do and for that to the victims, I am so so sorry and I promise that something like this will never ever happen again. I also feel like I want apology to my friends, family, team members and also fans that had to watch this all go down again to all of you guys I once again wish that I had listened earlier on. You guys saw this and I didn't and I'm really really sorry for not taking that seriously and not being a better person and a better role model like I promise that I would be. I'm going to be taking some time away to reflect and further educate myself on these topics. I think at this point it's really important that I do so so I'm able to follow through with my word and prove to you guys that I will be a better person. Even though I won't be here posting, I do want people to know that I will still be here available listening and learning. At this point, if you made it all the way through the video, I really appreciate it and just wanted to say thank you for listening and I hope to never disappoint you again. See you soon."
064_Lindsay,"So last week I was in a restaurant in North Carolina and we were sitting at the bar and the owner was sitting right there because they were about to close and my mother starts talking to her and somehow or other the owner just looks at me and she's like, well, what do you do? And you know, I wasn't about to tell her on my YouTuber. So I was like, I'm a writer. I mean, say I am technically. And she's like, what do you do? So I told her my name and she's like, I'm gonna Google you and I was like, okay, but I'm super canceled right now. And she like laughed and clearly thought I was kidding or maybe didn't know what that meant or, you know, knew it in some like right wing way. And then she like Googled me and like started laughing because the first thing and you know, like the questions people ask is, why is Lindsay Ellis canceled? And I mean, why indeed? But before I get into this, I need to lay some groundwork. Ladies and boomers of the jury. Here you go. Canceling is a public shaming of a member of a community for some violation of that community standards by other members of that community. But the term actually originated with a 1981 song called Your Love Is Canceled by the band Sheik. The song was inspired by a bad day guitarist Nile Richards went on at the height of the band's success, where in his day behaved in a way that he felt was presumptuous and unacceptable, which really turned him off. So basically it was inspired by this idea of any potential future we might have had, any potential love that might have developed, canceled. The song was not a hit at the time, but it stuck around and over the decade to the term as used in the song, started appearing in other pieces of art and music, including in songs by rappers like 50 Cent and Louwein, until eventually gaining popularity in the vernacular of Black Twitter. In this original vernacular use, declaring someone or something canceled was not really an attempt to like, instigate a boycott or hold someone to account, but more of a personal decision, not unlike Sheik's original song, canceling them in the television of your mind. So to cancel someone wasn't a call to de-platform, it was more just saying, you stepped out of line, so I'm done with you. Like when the city of New York canceled Mayor de Blasio for eating pizza with fork and knife, which to be fair is the only reason to criticize the man. The connotation of this term with callouts and de-platforming didn't happen until a few years ago, as me too began and callouts did lead to some powerful people actually losing things. According to Washington Postwriter Clyde McGrady, as callouts led to greater consequences, some people became nervous about how social media had changed power dynamics in the court of public opinion. Cancel culture was the diagnosis, and the term became a catch all defense for those trying to evade public criticism of any kind. But now, cancel is just another word that white people have taken and run into the ground. So like woke before it, it has gone from AAV E vernacular to right-wing grievance buzzword, which is more or less where we are today. Pretty quickly, and we are now seeing wokeism and diversity and inclusion. This is just a cancel culture, and I will tell you, the people at home should be scared because their ball game is next, their business will be next. If it continues, it won't just be Republicans who get canceled, it won't just be the president of the United States. The cancel culture will come for us all. So I have a lot that I want to unpack here, because I've had a bit of an ordeal that led to me realizing that I was bad for Twitter and Twitter was bad for me. And so I deleted my account. And for some dumb fucking reason, the fact that I deleted my Twitter account not only made like actual news, my name was trending for several days. Is this another video about canceling or worse the dreaded apology video? Like do these people not realize I'm not a real celebrity? I'm the number 21,000thish most subscribed channel on YouTube, and I've published all of one book that only reached number seven on the New York Times list. But it did have a New York Times list. So we'll get into widening a minute, but like I'm neither going to go full Andrew Cuomo. You're being canceled by multiple credible allegations. You're never going to be president Andy, or full crying apology video, though those do seem to be good for business. And I just ask that you press pause for a moment, and even just for 10 seconds, just cover this in prayer because there is so much healing that needs to take place. Some of the time. No sir, I've decided to do the one thing Americans should never do and vote third party. It's been a long time since we've been a list hasn't it. So here we go. List. Part one. Twitter is garbage. In the Halcyon days of the early 2010s, Justine Saco was a PR executive who traveled often for work. And not having many Twitter followers herself often tweeted pity little nothings, which on the morning of December 20th, 2013, as she was boarding a flight at Heathrow for a work trip, included this tweet going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white. Okay, so on its face, this is pretty inexcusable. It didn't take long for the tweet to catch the eye of Sam Biddle, then an editor at Gokermedia, who signaled boosted it with a comment, and now a funny holiday joke from IAC's new PR boss. The flight from Heathrow to Cape Town was 11 hours and in that 11 hours, attention to this tweet spread like wildfire, in credulity, horror, disgust, and also very quickly glee excitement. Saco had less than 200 followers and being on a plane with no internet didn't know that she was Twitter's villain of the day, nor that she was one of the top trends worldwide. So there was a delicious irony to the fact that this woman had been canceled and didn't even know it. People had her flight number, track it obsessively. We're just thrilled with this idea that she was going to land and realize she had been found out. The hashtag has Justine landed yet also began to trend. Someone even went to the Cape Town airport when she landed, took a picture of her, and shared it with the rest of the world. A few months later, upon being asked why it appealed to him, Sam Biddle said of the incident, the fact that she was a PR chief made it delicious. It's satisfying to be able to say, okay, let's make a racist tweet by a senior IAC employee count this time, and it did. I do it again. But while people of course gleefully obsessed over the tweet, no one seems interested in why she said it or what she meant by it. No matter how you cut it, it's a bad look. It's a flagrant flaunting of privilege. So it's funny that she got fired. I mean, I'm not going to, she had it bad for a while. And like I don't want to speculate on exactly how ruined her life was. But it would also be reasonable to assume that this is a joke about white privilege, right? That it was bad and insensitive and made light of a terrible affliction that still kills thousands of people every day, but that she didn't mean it literally. And at the time, everyone involved seemed to think that of course she deserved to have her life ruined over it. Even if they understood it was a joke about white privilege. Justine Saco's family in South Africa were African national congress supporters, the party of Nelson Mandela. They were longtime activists for racial equality. So while I can't read her original intent, perhaps she felt worldly enough and enough in the club and enough of an ally that she could comfortably make such a joke and that it would be understood. White people do this a lot. And I cannot say I am not guilty of this too. A year later, Saco said to John Ronson, author of So You've Been Publicly Shamed, to me it was so insane of a comment for anyone to make. I thought there was no way that anyone could possibly think it was literal. Living in America puts us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on in the third world. I was making fun of that bubble. While also conceding, I had no business commenting on the epidemic in such a politically incorrect manner on such a public platform. Biddle got caught up in his own shitstorm when he tweeted the following in 2014. And you'll never guess who was mad on the internet in 2014. Ultimately, Gamergate is reaffirming what we've known to be true for decades. Nerds should be constantly shamed into great indisubmission. Then adding, bring back bullying. I was there man. Bold of you to provoke them like that. Well you can guess what happened. There was a massive campaign against him, some from obvious bad faith right wing trolls, but some who seemed to think that he literally was advocating for a return to the 1950s where dumping books of dorky middle schoolers was derigur. Biddle publicly apologized to Saco on the anniversary of her, well it wasn't called canceling it. Twitter-wide dog pile, let's call it writing, Twitter is a fast machine that almost begs for misunderstanding and misconstruel. Deliberate misreading is its lubricant. The same flatness of affect that can make it such a weird and funny place also makes it a tricky and dangerous one. Jokes are complicated, context is hard, rage is easy. By this point they had actually become friends. And comparing their experiences he said, structurally we had made the same sort of joke. Here is what a truly horrible person, a person whose attitudes were entirely opposite from mine and those of the people who know me would say. You could argue that hers would worse conjuring a real and pernicious attitude that had resulted in systemic historical oppression and mass death, but the impulse was the same and so were the reactions. So even though there's a disconnect between the intended interpretation and the actual interpretation, there's also a disconnect between the severity of the crime and the gleeful savagery of the punishment. And this is not relegated to the early 2010s, it happens now more than ever. Twitter always has a villain of the day. Before me it was shrimp bean dad. I don't know. Something something milkshake duck. Got a my milkshake duck? You like up too old to be a milkshake duck? I've been around too long to be a milkshake duck, right? To a certain extent the villain of the day almost falls as script, especially now that we've all been losing our minds because we've all been inside for a year doing nothing but looking at our phones. Person says dumb thing. It gets some attention. Person gets defensive. The defensiveness spurns outrage. People start coming out with receipts. The OP deletes their account. And Twitter is garbage because the user experience UX as they call it in the industry is designed to encourage this kind of behavior. It's engagement fast and emotional and satisfying and easily communication through Twitter often happens through shorthand, micro interactions that fit a limited number of predetermined narratives and scripts because you're exposed to thousands of these per day, which is why we have these Twitter script phrases such as, wow, this blew up, friendly reminder, casual reminder, mask off. I don't know who needs to hear this, but thank you for coming to my TED Talk. Should have stayed in the drafts. Read the room. I'm trying to see something. I'll just leave this here. Asking for a friend. Send tweet. The list goes on. And the way it provokes rage and dog piles is baked into the way the very platform itself is designed. Twitter as a company has a really big problem where outside of its user base, its reputation is quite bad. And it hasn't really seen an increase in active users in years. When a site hits its peak in terms of total active accounts, there is still capitalist pressure to increase value and profit. A shrinking pool of eyes plus a need to increase revenue equals a service that needs to squeeze more blood from the same stones. So, every UX decision is geared towards increasing time spent with eyes on the screen. That's why they've developed non-chronological timelines, tweets that get added to your feed by virtue of other people liking them, God damn fucking quote tweets, and so on. Twitter is designed quite literally to be addictive. They aren't getting new users, so they have to keep the ones who are there from logging off. Twitter wants you to post and it wants you to boost and it wants you to engage. So, it will put as few barriers between the user and engagement action as possible. So, with all that in mind, there's no wonder that among the many pre-written shorthand Twitter scripts, Twitter's villain of the day is even a thing, and that it's a common truism on Twitter that the only goal is not to become the villain of the day. The unspoken understanding that it can be anyone if they're not careful. Engagement is often driven by outrage, and so we have this combination of high emotionality with a desire to perform. Social media is designed to manipulate our desire for approval, and a part of that these days is the desire to perform allyship. White people in particular all want to be told they're one of the good ones, which is why people like Justine Sacco gain such attention in the first place. In a fundamentally unjust world, it's satisfying to take a costeted bigot down a peg, so if we can only get one more wrong-headed bigot head on a pike, humiliate one more blackface steward or one more appropriative food blogger, we could heal this world. And inevitably, it was my turn. On Friday, March 26th, 2021, I was Twitter's villain of the day. So for those of you who haven't yet seen my offending tweet, let's have it, my Justine Sacco moment. Are you ready to see why mommy's cancel? Also, watch Shriya and The Last Dragon, and I think we need to come up with a name for this genre that is basically Avatar The Last Airbender Reduxes. It's like half of all YA fantasy published in the last few years anyway. That's it. That's the tweet. So I imagine some of you are very confused. Part two, valid criticism. So from what I can tell, the whole thing originated when some Southeast Asian artists and animators read the tweet as being dismissive and reductive and implying all Asian-inspired things are the same genre. And to me, it was made even more frustrating by the fact that several of the people who started this hadn't even seen the movie. In fact, most people who were getting involved with this conversation hadn't even seen the Dragon movie. Looks like no one saw the Dragon movie, but here's the thing. I kind of had my own has Justine landed yet experience by popping off the tweet, reading a few responses who understood where I was getting at, going to bed, and it blew up while I was asleep. Hashtag has lensy woken up yet. And because by the time I woke up, I'd already gotten a few like, oh my god are you okay? Messages from friends before I even open Twitter. By the time I looked at my timeline, I saw very little that I would consider valid criticism. So I feel like I need to establish that this whole thing stopped being about valid criticism very, very quickly. And I'll talk about that later in the video. But by the time I woke up, it had already blown way past this is a careless display of white privilege to this sort of thing as a contributing factor to the mass murder of Asian women that just happened. So this is what we call an overstatement of harm. It had gone from possible insensitive microaggression from a sea list YouTuber to contributing to hate crimes. And that didn't feel like anything I would consider valid. So it's, you know, early in the morning I just woke up and I responded with frustration because I was being ascribed in intentionality, which was not there, which, well, if anyone who spent any time on Twitter can tell you, getting defensive and doubling down is about the last thing anyone should do. So that was an oopsie. And I tried to give, you know, some credence to the valid criticism by saying, like, you know, if you squint, I can kind of see what you're saying. And well, foreign phrases, bring me some holy longer than the veteran I would kick off my brain just as I said. Well, actually it's been what puehing include in that information kind of friendship, that was after watching a video of a horror movie that videographer Nancy Itemc tell me otherwise. The phrase sent me off a name, but it did not mean anything that you think I really am. Get me on air if you want. is it not a lot to say? It's over and over and over, which is bound to make anyone a little bit defensive. So when all of these things are coming at you, it's impossible to genuinely consider actually valid critique in a timely fashion, because your defenses are at 100. And when I'm being accused by hundreds of people of contributing to anti-Asian-American hate crimes, by saying that the Disney thing reminded me of the Nickelodeon thing, it's honestly kind of stunning to me that any reasonable person would expect someone in my position to take in all of these hundreds of tweets, process them reasonably, and within minutes be like, hmm, yes, I see your point reasonable ones, because I am able to parse you out from the people saying I'm responsible for hate crimes. Now, before we go forward, it must be acknowledged that being any person of color in the United States right now is just to be constantly worn down in a million tiny ways every day all the time by a society that is low-key. Shitty. High key, shitty. It's shitty. These critiques don't come from nothing, and there are issues both in the film industry and the culture at large that is making people hyper-vigilant. I'm not going to follow that with a, however, I just want to lay that groundwork and acknowledge that. Part three, white nonsense. I know that's not the most PC way of saying that, but I have many, many white friends, so I'm allowed to say that. So in the case of this tweet, I went to bed, morning on the East Coast, and you know, there was some discourse by people who, you know, had some valid upset, and the nations all lived together in harmony until the whites attacked. Because a common refrain of these valid criticisms were that I was ignoring POC voices and talking over POC voices. But the vast vast majority of the avalanche of angry I was getting was from white people. Not all, but definitely, at least in terms of the extremely hyperbolic ones, this is the majority. White people, come here, come here, we need to have a chat. I think maybe we need to admit that those of us on the progressive side of the fence, as it were, are feeling kind of underpressure these days. We are horrified by the racial injustice of the world, especially in the US. We feel we need to perform action, but aren't really presented with very many opportunities to do so. My friend and PBS co-host Princess Weeks remarks during another stupider Twitter thing that happened a few weeks prior about fan fiction ethics. Actually, it's about ethics and fan fiction. It deeply amuses me when people treat shipping pro and anti with so much political importance when they literally apply that to nothing else, and to remove all nuance and context, to share fake quotes and facts, to perpetuate harm in order to own people over the right for two white people to kiss. When you marginalize a really queer BIPOC and marginalize people for what? In other words, often white progressive site black voices when in service of your... well in this case, ship. It was Hannibal or... oh my god, this is so stupid. You're interested in black voices when it's in the service of poning another white person or white creator, who to disagree with, but show little interest for issues or advocacy that actually concerned black voices in their community, independent of set ponege. Only to immediately be told you're not a real queer little girl, you privileged little twat by a white lady about 15 minutes later. To be clear, this was... this discussion was about fan fiction. This was about pretend people kissing... Pretendly. So I saw a lot of melee mouth smug nothing about do better and listen to POC. Always listen to POC. Why aren't you listening to POC? Elevate POC voices. Always. Okay. Hoomst. Hoomst is the valid person of color, oh allies of the jury. Because I did listen to a lot of POC, both in public and in private, and I got to tell ya, there's a diversity of opinions, almost like people of color on a monolith. Marginalized communities are not without diversity or conflict, so treating it as such is totally reductive and ignoring other POC voices by centering the loudest or angriest as the most authoritative. A problem only compounded by the way Twitter is designed, which I have already argued, is bad. As I was going back and forth over, like, the time line and everything that had happened, I found this private message from fellow YouTuber who I have to disclose is half Vietnamese because this is relevant. And he said, I'm trying not to say anything I'm going to regret here, but I have very little respect for the people dogpiling me in mind in the defense of a typically derivative corporate product from the biggest media company in the West because two of its seven writers and zero of its directors were Asian. This in private, of course, because, you know, you didn't want to get harassed. So I find the listen to POC refrain because it's only trotted out in the service of white people poning other white people, very revealing because what they mean is listen to the POC we can use to pown someone else. But the POC we don't agree with? But note this hilarious exchange between two white people arguing over my riot week. When pressed on what exactly it is I need to admit wrong doing for this woman says, again, you're just another white woman talking over actual POC concerns. I love this exchange because this person, one of the shit billion white people mindlessly regurgitating this listen to POC shorthand. The very same person who called Princess a privileged twat, you're not a real queer little girl. Princess is law in action. There's this incredibly childish dichotomy with the way a lot of people discuss racism that there are the racists and the non-racists. The two genders and the way to solve racism is to root out the racists and cast them on to racist island. Away from me and mine, the non-racists, one of the good ones. They do this because they are insecure about their own internalized racism. They cannot conceive that they have any that thought is terrifying to them because a racist is the worst thing you can be. So instead of doing any introspection, they remain hyper vigilant to root out the secret bad people. So everyone else will know they're one of the good ones. Racism is a complex system upheld from all wings of our society, from laws to hiring practices to generational wealth to community redlining to internal biases to individual actions. We live in a white supremacist society. When you live in a pigpin, you're gonna get covered in shit and all of us have the stink on us. And I don't just mean the white, all of you blocked blocked blocked none of you are free from sin, but especially the whites. And yet people still have this like LB the racist dragon attitude about how racism works. Why are you crying so? I'm crying because all of those horrible villagers chased me into the scary cave. I think it's because I'm so racist. Get your hand off my tail, you'll make it dirty. Racism isn't a system perpetuated by many many things, including actions, but it character trait a disease that people try to hide from the world because they know if they're found out they'll get banished to racist island. And suddenly he wasn't racist anymore. While there are still of course racist hate crimes and the like most general displays of racism don't come out of grand like cross burning style gestures, but out of ignorance, carelessness or negligence. And for white people a lot of it is just the reality of benefiting from a system designed to privilege you. So I'm not gonna waste my breath on the I'm not a racist line of defense. I'm a white woman from Tennessee, my family is mostly uneducated white trash. I'm not gonna be like yeah I didn't internalize any of that. I'm special. I shot out of the womb on the skate. We all have the stink on us. Yes. Even you. The reason I bring this up is because another thing that happened after that tweet was the sharing of the receipts. Thousands of people passing around screencaps of tweets and videos and blog entries and anecdotes from my personal life proving that this was not just a one-off. Oh no. I have a long history. It was high time I was banished to racist island. And it's true. I do have a long history of being on the internet longer than pretty much all of you statistically probably. And there is a list of sins floating around Twitter carefully and obsessively curated over a period of 13 years. Amazing. Is it because there's a pandemic? Where do you guys get all this free time? So I've been accused of a lot of terrible things and remanded for never owning up to my mistakes. Well today is your day I receive keepers. You guys have worked so so hard on this. So I am going to give you what you asked for. Finally all that hard work meticulously coming through every word I've ever said is gonna pay off. Well that's what you wanted wasn't it? Part 4. My list of sins. You were prepared for this to turn into a drama channel where you? Yeah maybe you were. I mean this is just what happens when they break your spirit utterly. So a big part of my self-preservation strategy over the years is to explain myself as little as possible because you know if you do that it's already a losing game and rarely if ever talk about my personal life. Clearly a big mistake on my part. Well today we are turning the page. We are spilling the tea the whiskey. I mean I knew I was saving this for a special occasion. Technically I remember whatever. I haven't used this one in a while. I just oh god yeah I really haven't used this in a while. So take a shot. Every time Lindsay Ellis does a problematic. So a common refrain during that weekend where I was trending was party A says Lindsay did a racism and party A's like well what did she do? Party A would show the tweet and party B would be like I don't get it. This doesn't seem like a big deal and then party A would be like ah no she has a long history of problematic and party B is like ah I get it now and then they skip off together into the sunset. Twitter user dragon lady Celeste Sparkle has conveniently collated my long storied history of all my other sins that explain why the Raya thing was just a mask off moment and I deserve this actually. A very good and normal thing to do with your finite minutes on this earth. Take down that youtuber. Take her down. Literally all day people have been replying to my tweet with more and more examples of truly harmful rhetoric that Ellie has been pushing for a while and all I can say is how the fuck has she not been called out on a mass scale before? Well dragon Sparkle Celeste she has. She's just never deleted her Twitter account before actually know that's not true. Last time I deleted my Twitter account I didn't trend because I guess I wasn't you know number 21,000 of subscribed YouTube channel by that point but the last time I deleted my account it was because of the you know white genocide crowd. So I guess that's something you have in common. I don't get why I'm like so hated by both sides of the political fence. I don't I don't think I'm like interesting enough to like gather this much attention or emotion. I drive a Honda Civic like Jesus. So thank you for compiling it in one convenient thread makes my job easier. Now the problem with this not at all creepy and obsessive list of every single one of my perceived transgressions over a period of 13 years is that it does not include the times when I have addressed them but you know I'm sure they just you know forgot to screen cap those tweets slash blog posts slash streams slash videos etc you know because this list isn't such good faith. Nor does it incorporate any of my entire body of work which I don't know it doesn't count apparently because you know the list of sins is the real me and the other stuff I do is for profit or something. So there's like a jillion of these grievances and you know this video is already like 12 attorneys long so believe it or not what I am about to address is non comprehensive because there are a lot of people who were really really dedicated to you know mask off and credit to where it's due this was spearheaded by the you know leftist Twitter but again a lot of these receipts originated with the right wing. I don't even I don't even want to call them alt right you know because they're not that principled you know like more more like you know gamer gate refugees the fortune for the lulls crowd diet Nazis let's call them. So some of this is as many of you have noted extremely bad faith interpretations of statements which only makes sense if you are working backwards from a foregone conclusion. That said I don't want this to be taken as me saying that I have never done anything wrong unambiguously I have we all make mistakes. So where I feel like an amendment or an apology is warranted I will do so. But where I feel like the criticism is being made in bad faith is unreasonable or is flat out on true I shan't bend the knee because we here at Lindsay Ellis industries are not in the business of serving bullshit. So I got my bill of shame here and as the black eyed peas would say let's get started. 2020 Harriet Tubman fanfic this one is like really popular. So the narrative here is that because of this tweet I ship Harriet Tubman with her in slaver and I want there to be fanfic of it. I'm just saying you have to be giving this a very weird read in order to think that's what I meant but I'm also going to go out on a limb and assume that most of the people mad about this have not seen the Harriet Tubman movie or if they have are not familiar with her real history. So the central conflict of the film revolves around Harriet's relationship to her in slaver a twinkie blonde guy named Gideon played by Taylor Swift's then boyfriend. They are around the same age they basically grew up together and early in the film he's framed somewhat sympathetically until he propositions her demands her submission and failtube which of course she refuses and then when she escapes he becomes obsessed with recapturing her and he is the central antagonist of the entire film. But here's the thing about Gideon he never existed he was completely made up for the film. Harriet Tubman's IRL in slaver at the time of her escape was a woman but instead of having the film center more around Harriet's journey after she got away from the brotus family it instead creates this character in the form of Taylor Swift's boyfriend as the antagonist a man who and I cannot express this enough did not exist in real life. So basically the film creates an OC that is like super obsessed with recapturing her and a movie where Harriet Tubman also has superpowers. It just felt a little fanficky to me and so one day I was on an airplane and the person next to me was watching it and I just kind of started wondering why the filmmakers decided to go that route with the film creatively because again it just kind of felt weird to me like and you know the final showdown in the film is between Harriet and Gideon in a forest that to me was somewhat evocative of the last showdown in the Force Awakens and this was also kind of like at the height of this sort of thing this tendency to fanfickify historical figures that was partially enabled by Hamilton so I just kind of idly have this thought like oh man I wonder if this movie spurned thick of these two characters oh god actually I'm not gonna check because I don't want to know. Usually I don't really check my mentions so I didn't see any anger when I tweeted that only a few days later when screen caps started circling and then I got some white women and my DMs demanding that I do better and apologize specifically not to them but to all of my black fans that I hurt so like an hour after I tweeted it I was like hmm I better take this down because this is the sort of thing that someone could take out of context and bad faith. Well so the reason I never addressed this is because like the read of that tweet in itself of me being thirsty for Harriet Gideon fanfick was just so absurd I didn't know what to say. Now to be clear no I should not have tweeted that at all I was thinking in terms of the creative decision to create Gideon being kind of tone deaf but the pithy way that I tweeted it still ostensibly glosses over the reality of white owners sexually abusing their slaves being the historical norm and that is in itself disrespectful. So while I definitely did not mean what people seem to think I meant I definitely should not have said that. I was as the kids say showing my ass. Next 2009 Autistic Tempered Tentrum. Oh boy I had to go way back for this one people wonder why I privated all my old videos. So I was in film school at the time and my class was 80% male and you know some of them had a friddie sense of humor and while I was talking about this movie the beauty and the beast the enchanted Christmas one of them made this remark about how the beast uh and I just kind of mindlessly regurgitated it. Be ashamed I'm gonna throw an autistic temper tantrum because I was with an edgy boy website at the time and I wanted to demonstrate that I wasn't like the other girls I was a cool edgy boy it was insensitive and careless I definitely should not have said that. Next 2013 The Prince of Egypt Anti-Semitism. God I just can't believe somebody kept this for so I'm just I'm sorry this just this took so much dedication. So the quam here is that I did an anti-Semitism because I don't like the way the Prince of Egypt you know functionally excuses the mass slaughter of innocent children in the narrative you know because the book of Exodus frames it as a necessary evil and yeah I just I don't really care for the Prince of Egypt and I just don't think the book of Exodus works as a kids movie because it's a kids movie it has to frame the protagonists as understandable and relatable to modern family audiences and frame what happens in the book of Exodus as you know all fine and good and the frame more of the movie even when the good guys do some light you know mass slaughter. Oh that's the way man it's a doozy I remember when we got to Exodus in Sunday school and you know when it got to the part of the wailing and lamentations of the Egyptian women you know when they woke up and there's a dead children like even of the age of five I was like yeah pretty fucked up. So my thought process here is that we take for granted the morality of narratives of biblical texts because we grew up with them and they just kind of have so much informed our cultural framework when if a story like this existed independent of the Bible it would probably be considered pretty messed up especially considering how the movie frames it as all pharaohs felt because he's such a stubborn jerk. Like at least in the Bible God keeps hardening his heart and the other thing is like in the way that the film progresses it's really funny to me when you're like mass slaughter of children happens pharaoh ray finds is weeping over the corpse of his only son and then Val Kilmose is morosely pieces out and then bam miracles. I mean I guess in a manner of speaking the 10th plagues in miracle and this is not to say you can't make a modern movie about the Bible I actually really liked Noah it's easily my favorite Darren Aaron off-ski movie because it leans in hard on how fucked up and traumatic it would be to have to sit back and you know watch and listen while every other human on earth dies you know because God said so. Just people every room there was no room for that. But this is also an example of me using Twitter to feel out other people's opinions before I do video content. The thing I will never do again. A lot of people were like yeah but you know this movie means a lot to me and you know a lot of that is because of like my religion or my culture and that was when I decided I was not ever going to touch this movie as a topic for a video and in the context of this thread I shouldn't have used the word genocide considering it's a film about Jewish characters and for that I do apologize. Like I don't think I'd be making the world a better place by talking about why I don't think the Prince of Egypt works because I don't feel that strongly about it. It's not a big deal. I'm not really here for thing you like is bad actually content for its own sake. Although I love how every tweet in this thread has trigger warnings. She didn't like the Prince of Egypt. Next. 2013 Charlie's Angels Nikob. This is another one I've addressed a few times most recently on a livestream a few years ago where we rewatched it and had a high old time laughing about what a comical example of early 2010's white feminism this was. You know what guys I'm sorry I'm calling it feminism is over I'm sorry I tried to do their best but it's our feminism too. I'm just gonna try everyone. I'm not sick of the go-mate me as I'm just I'm just about to deliver. Yeah so not gonna lie this one's pretty bad. This whole thing came about when I was on Twitter one day talking about doing a video on Charlie's Angels and trying to think of like how visually to dress myself that was like the opposite of Charlie's Angels and someone on Twitter was like hey you should do it in a Berka with like pig tails poking out and I thought that idea was funny. It's too confusing. We don't know what we want it is apparently way too much to ask that women like either have a certain body type or dress a certain way without being judged for it so two options. Berka or slut. That's not Berka and that's a false dichotomy. And even at the time several of my Muslim followers were like please do not do this this is a bad idea and okay so this is not excusing it but here is some context so at the time my next door neighbor was an Egyptian ex-pat named Hudger and she was slash is full Nikabi meaning whenever she goes outside she dresses in like the full you know well basically what I was wearing when it's the pig tail sticking out and basically Hudger was like the only next door neighbor I've ever been friends with and it's another one of those weird problems of considering cultures and monolith like one would assume or at least I assumed that like she would have zero interest in talking to me and we would have nothing in common considering she's like super super religious and yes some women do it voluntarily but that's something I'm not gonna get into it but basically one day we started talking when I was watching the hunchback of Notre Dame too loud really and she was like she caught me on the landing like so hunchback of Notre Dame huh so anyway I mentioned this thing to her and she was like yeah whatever that's Larry as long and so this is not excusing it but I kind of took that as well my friend I know personally said it's fine so I'm going to you know take that opinion over these strangers but again even at the time I had people on Twitter saying do not do this thing and I ignored them and either way I wasn't making content for Egyptian ex-pats which I'm pretty sure she's never even seen one of my videos and either way it was also completely unnecessary to the point of the video like I could have made the exact same point with like a potato sack with pig tail sticking out and it probably would have been funnier this one was bad and wrong for a lot of reasons and I do regret that next 2018 Stephanie Meyer app illusion so the dear Stephanie Meyer video was about me reflecting on how carelessly I had participated in the casual misogyny surrounding the early twilight backlash around the time that the first movie came out you late 2000s and so the general objection here is that the video is racist because I neither mention nor condemn Stephanie Meyer's depiction of the quillute people so I'm not going to lie and say I didn't consider addressing it and I did have some conversations on Twitter with Indigenous people that were actually productive see Twitter's not always bad just you know mostly but there were two main reasons I decided not to discuss it in that video you know besides the fact that that was back when I was trying to keep videos around like the 20 minute mark one was the fact that during the backlash of the late 2010s twilight's appropriation of the quillute was not a common criticism and certainly was not weaponized against Stephanie Meyer it is now but that just was not a substantial proportion of the backlash at that time the second one is once again we come to this question of the voices of a group being considered a monolith I definitely talked to some Indigenous people that condemned it but I also saw some that were like yeah actually I mean like it I mean no it's not the best but I liked it it was something new it was like a representation we hadn't seen before it was refreshing to have Jacob as this character who isn't like a noble savage stereotype it isn't like magically in tune with nature and doesn't have like a sad broken family you just like a nice normal kid who lives on the res and vibes you know at least in the first book again this video was addressing a point in time before breaking dawn came out so I just wasn't really comfortable making a value judgment on which of those was the correct opinion especially because it didn't really feel relevant to the central thesis and it's also a complicated issue that just didn't feel at home in that video like for instance on the one hand the way the quillute are depicted in twilight puts the onus on the real quillute to educate people that they're not werewolves and then the elders they uh you know said hey missan you gotta get out there and educate people that were really not werewolves but on the other hand the attention twilight has brought to the tribe has helped them tremendously not just through tourism but actually helped them get land back from the feds it's opened the way for our tribe economically and then the media it helped us a lot you know our ancestors and our past council members have been fighting for over 50 years for our northern boundary dispute to actually have that day and and have the president Obama signed you know a document saying that you know this land is yours it was like wow but on the other other hand Stephanie Meyer is a multi-millionaire many times over it is kind of weird that she has given none of that wealth as far as I know back to a people whose culture she appropriated you know for a supernatural love triangles and while we're on this topic Amanda the Jedi has been doing a twilight retrospective and she brought to my attention a fundraiser that the quillute have been running for a few years to help move some of their village to higher ground to you know protect them from all the tsunamis and you know the climate change and whatnot so that is linked below if I did the video again especially now that my videos are like eight hours long I'd probably add a little bit mentioning that this conversation became prominent later but this criticism does kind of always give me weird vibes because it usually comes with this subtext of and this is why Stephanie Meyer did and still does deserve the harassment she got one that is not why people were hassling her in 2008 so I could not fold that into the valid common criticisms folder and two no one deserves that next 2018 transphobia via tarzan I genuinely honestly really do regret this one and I have said so a few times why do they never screen cap the retractions weird when it was announced that LaFou would become the first out gay character in a Disney movie the L's the G's the B's the T's and of course all you filthy filthy Q I think it was like 15 minutes after this video went live that I was like oh god why did I do that? was because I was thinking about the optics so much as it wasn't a good joke like I should have used Mulan goddamn my eyes I thought this idea of a fab turk being angry about wearing a dress was funny but in hindsight I really should have considered that it wasn't just any Disney character it was a gorilla and animal that trans women are sometimes compared to and it was extremely careless and it's a shame because I otherwise really do like that video next 2020 trans men don't experience suppression actually I didn't say that I said that anecdotally I had heard from a few trans men over my 80 odd years of existence that they felt that they didn't experience the same level of scrutiny or harassment that they had before they transitioned because of misogyny that said this was also before Elliot Paige came out and I've seen so many people be beastly to him so you know that is a strong counter example and I could say that I can't speak for all trans men's experiences but I didn't claim to and I'm not sure how you could read that into my statement I was just repeating anecdotes I had heard so some of the hate mail I've been getting is calling me a turf because of this which I think is really funny it's called a turf for saying trans men are men all right next 2017 Zack Snyder hates his mother once again tweet clipped out of context and another one the gamer gate refugees were really obsessed with not that you guys have anything in common but so these tweets are all long deleted but this was a conversation between me and another film critic I forget who talking about how difficult it is to meaningfully discuss sex Snyder's films especially at the time because his fans are little touchy and one Snyder fans said you know I don't mind when critics talk about his movies I just don't like it when they say stuff like Zack Snyder hates his mother and this was just absurd to me because I have never ever heard a real critics say that so I responded with what I considered obvious sarcasm well I actually have it on good authority that Zack Snyder hates his mother so this was really bad timing because I made this joke literally the night before the news broke that autumn Snyder had killed herself the very night before and so I wake up to just this flood of outrage in my mentions and like I am so deeply confused before I even realize what's going on and it was just like oh my god so I don't like Zack Snyder's movies for a lot of reasons but he does seem like the rare decent powerful man in Hollywood and I can't imagine how awful it was to go through what he did especially during such a huge production and I'm impressed and appreciate that the Snyders have been doing such broad advocacy for suicide prevention now but like harassing me in the name of like suicide prevention advocacy is like come on now this is by no means Zack Snyder's fault and I do not mean to imply that it is again from all I've heard through my Hollywood grapevine he seems like a decent person and he can't control what his fans do even though I wish he had done it sooner he has finally disavowed the really bad ones and I also can kind of appreciate that he probably didn't really have the emotional bandwidth to pay attention to that sort of thing for a long time let alone you know address it but I'm also sure that the many many Snyder fans who have told me to kill myself in the last four years because of this tweet just didn't know about my own history either way I'm sure it's an issue they all care deeply deeply about all over a few Martha jokes Jesus next 2020 did a misgender this was a misunderstanding John Mulaney didn't ask an Elmano log that I didn't love I said something about it Curio responded to that I said yeah I know thanks John addressing John we talked it out over Twitter I apologized those tweets are still up next 2012 defending the yellow face and cloud atlas I'm surprised there are no screen caps for this probably because the diet Nazis didn't find that worthy of preservation but this is true there was a lot of criticism of cloud atlas at the time and I said something to the effect of I didn't think it mattered as much as like you know the conversations around black face because they had a different history and I don't I don't know why I said that I don't know what the hell I was thinking like for one thing I was definitely revealing my ignorance because like yellow face is just you know a topic I had never really studied I'd done plenty on black face nothing on yellow face imagine falling on your sword for cloud atlas of all things my podcast partner is gonna be so disappointed I'm sorry copy so yeah I still like cloud atlas but the creative decision to use yellow face and the way that they did is pretty inexcusable and honestly it does kind of make me uncomfortable to watch now my bad next 2015 bisexual erasure so again another post clipped out of context and it is quite literally the only time I have ever written about my sexuality and stuff like this is the reason why I was like wow never talking about that again it is from my now deleted blog but I linked the archive page below and in effect it was basically me kind of working out my feelings on feeling like bisexual erasure was almost a form of privilege and I still kind of think that's true and the thing about sexuality is it's just like such a personal thing and that's why this like conflation of like the political and the personal while necessary often makes me really uncomfortable because it was like such a painful process for me and one I never really figured out how to reconcile so I just never did so I've never really had a coming out or embracing my truth more just like slow quiet begrudging acceptance like I just have these laundry list of experiences like for being in college and going to gay clubs and having lesbians suddenly turned cold when they find out you're bisexual to the popular axiom at the time of by now gay later or highway to homo or gay until May to dance average way up into the 2010 saying that bisexual men don't exist or tall phase or all the way to former respected person Glenn Greenwell saying that the bisexuals are transing the lesbians out of existence as recently as last month so I can't help but feel a sort of imposter syndrome every time I do anything even tangentially pride related I feel tolerated but not accepted and why do I want to go to that parade like oh you're here fine I guess we're contractually obligated let you in so I think for a lot of bisexuals especially women we do kind of live in this liminal space of both privilege and erasure it is painful to feel ostracized from the community when accepting your identity has caused you so much pain in the first place but at the same time you can opt out you can in effect passes straight like if I had a dollar for every time someone called me a straight white woman in the last few weeks although that would take care of my patreon for at least a month and to answer very good faith actors like Glenn Glenn Greenwell and Glenn what was his mother thinking so to answer very good faith actors like Blur Blur Blur Blur quest to why proportionally bisexual people tend to end up in heterosexual relationships 75 25 rather than the 50 50 allegedly should be hmm wonder why that could be you know just besides the fact that as a proportion of humanity there are more straight people to choose from well here I am making a thing out of it am I in the club now next 2014 did a bisexual gatekeeping against Mara Wilson ah so we have reached the speculations on my private life portion of the game show is now a good time to bring up the fact that Lindsay Ellis was super shitty and bifobic tomorrow Wilson when she came out as bi or are we giving people of color a moment to drag her for filth before we bring up other shit be honest I guess we're doing this you may know Mara Wilson from her work as a trial star in films like Matilda and Mrs. Doubtfire in the last odd decade or so she's worked as a nonfiction author a voice actor twitter person who makes approximately 680 retreats per day and also occasionally writer of op-eds for outlets like the New York Times in 2016 when she gave an interview about coming out as bisexual it included this quote I remember being with bisexual friends I said I think I might be bisexual and a friend of mine who's not a friend anymore said no you're she was a gatekeeper okay okay that gatekeeper that's good I'm gonna use that so I'm not sure how this random twitter user decided that she was talking about me as the gatekeeper in this interview from 2016 but someone decided she must have been talking about me based on no evidence whatsoever and the accusations stuck mostly because Mara liked that tweet and then about 50 other tweets of people having a high old time with me as twitter's villain of the day and I really don't know where this random user's supposition came from because I have been very very careful never to say anything about her publicly either by reference or implication despite the many times she has talked about this awful former friend she used to have either you know interviews podcasts you know sub tweets print it was me I was the turkey all along I was wondering what that turkey was doing there and to my knowledge she's never indicated that I was the gatekeeper until the liking of this tweet thereby validating these suppositions cool cool cool cool okay all I'm about to blow some minds but first I need to provide some context Mara and I were at a point in history friends and literal neighbors you know we were both in our mid 20s we lived like two blocks from each other we were both recent NYU grads and we were both aspiring writers and many people who've been following us for a long long time have observed hmm who to used to be really good friends and then suddenly you were not and that is true but here's the thing the anecdote about the gatekeeping bisexual former friend is also true I do remember the conversation she is talking about and while the wording she uses isn't how I remember it the basic gist of the conversation is true she told me she thought she might be bisexual and I kind of casually dismissed on the grounds of her dating style reminding me of the former roommate who prided herself on being straight it was a fairly short conversation it happened one time seven years ago yeah and we never spoke out of it again so this conversation happened at least a year before we stopped speaking which was over five years ago and the reason why was a series of compounding factors this was not one of them at least to my knowledge and the truth is I don't know why I said what I said or reacted the way I did if that had happened now I would not have reacted in that way but even then I don't know why I was so dismissive offhand about something that I know from my own experience can cause a lot of pain and isolation and it only came up the one time was immediately dropped and we never spoke of it again and for that reason I never thought much of it I didn't consider that she wasn't just kind of saying something off the cuff but was actually admitting something that she had been considering for a while to someone that she thought would understand and that person dismissed her and I didn't even begin to know that this caused any hurt until almost two years after that conversation even happened because she didn't come out until a few months after between the two of us and I cannot express this enough had nothing to do with this like this is something I feel like I need to press on these so and so as a secret bigot crusaders does it occur to you that you can dislike someone without some irrican-syllable ideological differences this is a personal falling out between two people that has nothing to do with the content we produce I produce and I just wanted to spell this narrative that like someone has to be like the secret bigot or you know mask off or there's always the wronged one and the abuser and one of these falling outs when it's just like sometimes people just don't get along kids I would love to know why Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice fell out but it is at the end of the day none of my business and they have made it known and they have kept the why under wraps rumble 40 years and honestly good for them life goals and though do trust that this bridge is well and truly forever burned I do sincerely regret that I reacted the way I did I think I was probably projecting my own experience with rejection and paying it forward and I am sorry for that and no I shan't be airing any more dirty laundry on this topic fascinating though it may be next 2009 the rape rap someone made a rape joke oh my god someone called the rape joke brigade officer I have an infraction I need to report to the ministry of rape jokes look honestly I'm shocked that Lindsay Ellis has not been canceled forever by the rape rap the zoomers that are canceling her haven't even discovered the old rape rap she made yet well very thoughtful that she finally released a mandarin and Japanese version of the original rape rap well this has been a long time coming hasn't it there is this semi infamous video I did back in 2009 which is called rape rap which is exactly what it sounds like the joke is that my friend Brian playing a rapping sexual predator says horrible things to me online because woman and I try to get him not to say these things and honestly I kind of want to give a slow clap to the diet Nazis because this is a fetch they have been trying to make happen for years and I'm honestly kind of happy for them you know like they have used this to hurt me and humiliate me and they sent it to like PBS affiliate PBS corporate trying to get me fired and they've uploaded like 800 mirrors to YouTube they've sent it to my colleagues they've spammed me with it for over a decade and it just never spread beyond the diet Nazi sphere and it's finally finally into the mainstream woke school twitter you know I'm happy for them they worked so hard for this so I know the people adding this to my list of sins are very very concerned about rape victims and that's why you're upset by this so I know you would want to know the context for this you aren't just thoughtlessly adding this to my ledger to help us wage people's moments of doubt that the harassment against me was in fact justified you care about context and here's your content warning so if you don't want to hear this skip to this time code we're bringing up it to Kila for this one this isn't even fake to Kila so when I was a sophomore in college my very first sexual experience with another human being was big reason why I was vulnerable to this person was so he took me back to his studio apartment and and when I woke up and realized what had happened I started freaking out and like I just I remember like they're being the smell and like so basically he just like pushed me out of his apartment and he gave me a $20 bill and just like slammed the door in my face and I mean what are you gonna do so I just like the $20 bill was enough money exactly to like for the cab ride home and then I got a nest quick you know like the chocolate milk and a bagel and then I go upstairs to my dorm room and I like just hork it all up and then I like take off my clothes and I'm just like burn the evidence on our gasto like I just like you know it was the clothes as full I just my roommate was out of town at the time so there was no but it so I just like burn the clothes and burn the evidence and I didn't tell anyone that this happened so nobody knew so about one year later I was at a a Dresden Dolls concert of all things and you know I think this was yeah this was 2005 and I was there with my roommate and we lived in the West Village and the concert was at Webster Hall and Webster Hall as it was about a 15-20 minute walk from our apartment in the West Village and I we got separated on the way home you know because you know a concert and partying but you know normally that's like no big deal because like it's no big deal to get separated from your college roommate for you know 10 minutes but when I get back to our apartment I find her on the stairwell covered in because by our neighbors so like are like are literally across the hallway neighbor so I just like see white I just like fly into this animal rage and I don't think it was like it couldn't have been more than like five or ten minutes before the police showed up and I was like still in full hulk mode and fortunately the ambulance showed up before they could take us to jail as they do so we went to the hospital and she got a rape kit done and so now I'm involved with that case cool cool cool cool cool cool all this while like this whole time I had not told anybody um what had happened to me like I wouldn't actually tell anybody what happened to me for like another uh I think it was like another year or two I think yeah it was probably like yeah it was like two years later um and of course I didn't do it in a healthy way I think it was probably yeah it was something like this you know like is this healthy so here's the thing when like something like this happens you know and like you know there's police involved and police reports and hospitalizations you know I'm besides the DA pressuring you out of pressing charges which is what they did to my roommate um and you know I didn't realize that was because you know they want to deflate the crime stats in their districts until about 15 years later when reply all did a did an episode on that um but the thing is like there's a lot of paperwork and like no this is relevant so basically like um she and I shared this like hanging file like for all of our paperwork that we had for like various things that were you just like you know financial aid um you know essays college stuff ray for the first like few days um it was just this like untouchable horrible thing that like happened and had to be endured and was just like this pall over both of us and you know and this was before the DA pressured her out of pressing charges and um so we had this folder and so like we just somehow are like I asked her like well what's in that folder and she's like right and we kind of like embellished the folder like with the musical so it was just like rape and like you know horror font the musical um and I'm not gonna lie and say this like began the process of healing categorically it didn't but you know it did make the reality of the situation like accessible you know joking about it brings it down to earth it's no longer this like unspeakable horror and um like you know of course life is based on mine in any way it is this um in why use TAs we're having a strike that semester um meaning that the undergrads were allowed to drop classes basically up until finals without penalty or a failing grade and what happened uh was that like that was the only semester where that was an option and if we're in for that technicality where I could drop classes up to finals I would have failed out of school I mean the failing out part is taken from my experience not the rape part I didn't I didn't give core of that tragic backstory so being just like this one two punch of horrible things like I just like I was honestly terrible like I like in so many ways I went canototic I wasn't supportive um and I just don't remember like just big chunks of 2005 and 2006 and that sucks because like I really you know treasure a lot of my time and education it didn't why you they're just like huge blocks of it that I don't remember um but I do remember this uh not long after I graduated a couple years later rape the musical came up in like a different context and my friends Brian and Pat both to this day or you know still two of my dearest friends um Brian even officiated my wedding so Brian had this jacket which he joked made him look like a flasher um and like somehow or he was like freestyle these wraps to me and Pat and I at the time found them just like hilarious and cathartic and I was like you know keep going and so we like started workshopping it and we're like oh let's make a sketch out of this and I just remember these like lame freestyle's while Pat just sat there with this like dead serious expression not paying attention and just me like dying laughing and like finding it honestly really helpful and I don't think like at the time I don't even think they knew I think they were just like humoring me uh so this was a way of tying in all of this like horrible nonsense that happened to me in my roommate in college with some of the misogynist garbage I was getting as a baby woman on the internet in 2009 so it was as the kids say a cop now with regard to this joky joky little sketch that makes such light of rape I know what you're thinking this must be so hard for you that's so sad for you that must have been super fucking hard for you but if this was indeed a copic-hope joky joke between friends should it not have remained private yes you observing good faith person you it should have but this was uploaded without my knowledge or permission without my consent you might say I even blogged about it because at the time I was of course getting calls for apologies and I was like absolutely not this happened without my permission and there's an archive link to that blog entry in the description if you vultures want proof so the way that this happened at all was at the time channel awesome um controlled all of our individual channels and we didn't upload them ourselves we uploaded them to an ftp and scheduled them and then someone else uploaded it for us so when I finished this video I did still think it was funny but I also realized that this should never see the light of day this can be just like a practice run for other sketchy things that we do and should stay a private joke between friends all the while forgetting that my export folder automatically uploaded directly to this ftp so months pass I forgot it was even there and then one day the guy who ran the schedule I guess got annoyed that I kept blowing my deadlines and he was like fine I'll just upload whatever's in that ftp folder but like I started getting these phone calls asking why I scheduled that and I'm like I didn't take it down but it was too late and now here we are so the diet Nazis love this video because you know they think I'm like this high-minded liberal who is like so holier than now and therefore that this exposes my hypocrisy and so we can use this to just like torment me and humiliate me and just like constantly like upload it and like I'll just see it like in my mentions and sometimes they'll send it to like my colleagues or my publisher just to like try to get them to get a reaction and so now WokeSchool Twitter has discovered it and just mindlessly adds it to my ledger of sins and so now here we are and I'm having to relive one of the worst times of my life just to get you people to back the fuck off she tried to pretend this and the rape rap Lindsay Ellis doesn't want you to remember this is the rape rap one more time for the home almost as tragic as her rape magic get a cancel over this and not the rain rap you did make rape rap so she's fine with edge of it I always thought that Lindsay Ellis would get canceled when her rape rap would be stuck to these woke people for years did you think they wouldn't eventually come for you just wait till the discovery of the rape rap I remind everyone of the rape rap that track is fire so like all of you just these these people who've been trying to get to me with it and think that like me staying silent is an admission of guilt rather than it being none of your fucking business even considering that this was not supposed to be made public and now these WokeSchool Digges adding it to like my ledger and trying to use it to discredit me all of you are just loathsome loathsome people and I hope you all and as I mentioned earlier this list is non comprehensive but and to everyone out there who is like you know you know what yeah but why are you making this all about you I didn't make this about me you did part 5 the tweet so if this tweet were a video essay that had been researched for months instead of a tweet popped off in a minute which I never will make I will never talk about either of these properties again it would probably be structured something like this avatar of the last airbender was a game changer in a lot of ways here's some of the things that influenced it shown an anime Asian folklore did did did did there's a new generation of American writers many of the people of color who were influenced by it anime and young adult literature have changed a lot because of this direct and indirect influence and honestly I think that's cool I think that shows and books are honestly much more interesting for it than that which came before me so with regard to the similarity between these two texts two big things stuck out to me one is the element-based co-lead being woken up by guitar after hundreds of years of sleep as the last whatever now you know come on in we have to go from nation to nation and in each nation you will acquire a skill until we face down the ding dang dong fire nation what started this whole mess and heal the world but the thing that stuck out most in my mind as a trend that I've been seeing a lot in animation and YA literature and it's not a bad thing to Jesus it's what I'm going to call for lack of originality the Zuko the princeling of the rival nation who has a lot to prove to their family and who serves as the principal antagonist for a while while our heroes bought from nation to nation and he chases them around but eventually starts to have a change apart and a redemption arc did to prepare prepare prepare now the reason I cited like half of why I fantasy again I did not mean literally half that that was hyperbole um well basically it was because that most of the why I fantasy that I had read because those were you know the big names that you know I had to read to be hept to the jive that were released in the last few years have avatar as influences the most high profile of which being children of blood and bone by tomi adi emi now I did enjoy this book and like raya it also made heavy use of the Zuko and for that reason it was the first thing that popped into my head as being similar to raya and yes avatar the last air vendor makes heavy use of asian and anime tropes but it was the piece of media that popularized a lot of these things in the us you didn't really see like redemption arcs over several seasons before that and now you see it all the time Steven universe does it the new she rod does it keepo kind of does it with frog and the monkey okay I never said the Zuko had to be sexy and now we have raya and the last dragon now if you did read into my tweet that I was dismissing this or saying it was a bad thing I guess I could understand that read because it wasn't very gracefully worded and it doesn't say anything positive but it doesn't say anything negative either it is an inherently neutral statement it is an observation it's not even a critique and so I was like this is not a dig yet crazy's and then the line is like oh you're calling POC crazy which is so disingenuous when the vast vast majority of people losing their shit at me my mentions were white people projecting their own insecurities at me like obviously yet crazy's was a joke but as a writer and a media critic it was just so frustrating for immediacy people interpreting the comparison of these two things as a dig like I was insulting one by comparing it to the other what is this like cinemasins brain poisoning thing being similar to other thing not bad one of the funnest things as a writer you get to do when discussing your book or your media is discussing the influences because ostensibly they are something the author loves and is excited to talk about so I also saw like a bunch of these like weird low digs like oh axioms end is so original oh axioms end is derivative like I know that I have marketed the damn thing on it being inspired by alien invasion movies and TV shows of the 90s and 2000s there's a reason why I made a bunch of content about those influences in the year leading up to its release do you want me to give you a list of them everything has influences and Avatar the last airbinder is one of the most successful and beloved children shows of all time author tomi adi yami said of children of blood and bone the book raya reminded me a lot of I have shadow shabber bydaniel hose older and to the right of it there's an imber in the ashes by sabata here and above it is Avatar the last airbinder children of blood and bone is the baby of all three and even one of the screenwriters of raya has said that although Avatar was not a direct inspiration we don't shy away from the comparison because it's a beautiful series no matter how many mental backpins I do even if you're tired of this take or feel like it's flattening everything inspired by the largest continent on earth I cannot begin to understand this causing hurt or anguish unless you are reading into it something that I did not say especially when I'm like the eight hundredth person to make this very milk toast observation screen junkies had released an honest trailer several days earlier making the exact same comparison for the exact same reasons long ago the five lands lived together in harmony then everything changed when the true nation attacked raya tar the last air dragon the avatar the like I mean raya and the last dragon and look at that dislike ratio I don't think there is a single video on my entire channel with a dislike ratio that low I wonder why they didn't get me backlash I wonder why it could be part six she deserved it if twitter had streets there would have been dancing in them when I deleted my account like justine saco getting fired like everyone held accountable by an online mob before me this was taken as a victory by many many people and so the problem with making a big thing out of this tweet which at worst could be considered an unintentional micro aggression made the outrage reaction to it kind of hard to justify which is why we need to establish a history of my offenses to bolster their case and this is where the list of sins comes in I'm trending on twitter for like two days there's all this discourse so of course people are going to have second thoughts like why are so many people talking about this maybe this has gotten out of hand maybe the backlash wasn't worth the original sin and here comes dragon Celeste and hundreds like her like oh no don't worry this is accountability here is the long list of sins proving that this is just mask off she has a long history how has she not been called up I know someone who's met her and they say she's a bad person so you don't need to feel bad about hounding her because she deserves it and my god just the joy people took in this like seeing me taken down a peg good fucking ridden spits good riddans good fucking riddans terrible human being dyslexations too y'all getting Lindsay Ellis is beautiful don't know shit about her I can just look at a white person and know they're awful can't stand that human being glad I won't have to see her tweets her takes were so awful and embarrassing I wouldn't want to be anywhere near her fuck Lindsay Ellis and her awful racism and for being a prominent fan to fan what it should be me but mostly the racism I hate her and Jenny Nicholson serene smiley faces Lindsay Ellis deleted people like Lindsay Ellis are finally facing consequences for being atrocious human beings Lindsay Ellis getting canceled is good actually I will die on this fucking hill what have I done to you are you are you rent fans so many times I've seen people show the damning evidence to others like see look at this only have the people they're showing it to be like I don't understand where you're getting this is there's some context I'm missing here is a woman of color doing that very thing to cap black demanding that she answer for sometimes collaborating with such a racist and cat basically responded why the fuck are you demanding that I answer for my white colleagues leave her the fuck alone and this is just the switches oh oh the joy the diet Nazis took in this god they love it when the left eats their own and why wouldn't they it's hilarious when your political enemies tear each other apart I mean to reiterate these people have been trying to take me down for years keep trying boys and part of that joy comes with this justification of what they perceive as someone with real power and wealth and privilege being taken down a peg it's like this bizarre delusion that I or any of my friends have any real power or influence outside of our very niche corner of the internet I am not a real celebrity I almost never get recognized in public I don't have a PR team or a manager or a stylist or a team of lawyers just one very anxious literary agent and one youtube agent who honestly he thinks this shit is hilarious I also kind of missed the diet Nazis because like they at least knew what they were they weren't harassing me like it was some civil rights campaign that might make the world marginally more just they were just bullies plain and simple and they were proud of it and you know honestly in hindsight I kind of respect that at least my mentions being full of like pictures of razor blades and dead animals and chlorox saying hey drink this you know at least that's honest I do appreciate that the people making good faith criticisms are not responsible for the people making bad faith criticism or for that matter threats or rejoicing in my downfall but it is beyond the scope of reasonable to expect me to take all this stimulus thousands of people screaming at me from reasonable to sadistic especially considering everything I've been through in my life and behave like the perfect victim if you just say the right thing we'll leave you alone if you just behave in the way we're asking we'll make it go away if you just apologize we just stop all she had to do was like listen she had a long history of problematic shit she never listened she should have done the work to make amends maybe next time don't call an entire marginalized group crazy she's a bifobic transphobic racist mess who deleted her account rather than apologize for being a piece of shit she couldn't take actual criticism for people who knew more than she did mother fucker all you had to do was apologize for a white bread take and move on deleted her own account then just apologize nuke shirt count instead of apologize totally unraveled under the slightest scrutiny deleted her account instead of saying I fucked up sorry why are you so emotional why are you so upset I'm not with the hundreds of people saying you're responsible for hate crimes and mass murder I'm not one of the people trotting out the obsessive documentation of every mistake you've ever made over the last 15 years I'm the reasonable one and I'm calm why aren't you calm why aren't you addressing this why hasn't she apologized when she going to apologize when are you going to apologize never becky the answer is never at least not to you someone on my subreddit wrote a really thoughtful essay on the whole situation and here is a quote from that abuse should always be a part of our analysis and we should be aware every single second that we participate in these conversations that our actions have the potential to excuse or perpetuate abuse we should take responsibility for that take steps to mitigate it and hold ourselves accountable this is why I have such distrust for the position why should I have to talk about abuse I'm not personally abusing anyone you should have distrust for that position because that is exactly what they said to me during gamer gate the exact same thing part seven your next what follows in campaigns like this is the other isolation tactic targeting your colleagues friends and loved ones this comes in two flavors demanding that the colleagues of the accused answered for their crimes or trying to de-platform said colleagues because you're already writing high off the previous victory so who's next Sarah's at his next Jenny Nicholson is next contra points is next Jenny in per fucking ticular Jenny is next Jenny your next Jenny next Jenny next Jenny next both Jenny Nicholson and contra points were trending at certain points during the weekend because of me fake screenshots of a racist tweet that Jenny never made spread like wildfire with the goal of getting her driven off of Twitter because of me and a year and a half ago that she was on the other foot because a lot of the same crowd was attacking Natalie it must needs be remarked that a huge contingent of the people who have it out for me right now hate me for sticking by Natalie during the angel buck incident about 18 months ago and if you want to know more about that there's the thingy thingy thingy and it's really only now that I can make sense of it that I got so many hate follows after that that people were so eager to screen cap anything and everything I said on Twitter no matter how minor or petty to create this narrative of me as a secret horrible person just because I stood up for my friend and I don't regret doing it I would do it again but it is insane that I am paying such a high price for that now and now my other colleagues are being targeted for no other reason than the crime of being friends with me for not publicly denouncing me for not validating their anger and why Jenny is one of the smartest most insightful people I know Sarah always floors me with how much research and nuance and sensitivity she brings to her topics and she's only 22 Natalie is well she's a whore but she's my whore these obsessive campaigns to try to push these narratives of my friends as bad people and secret turfs and secret racists are baffling to me global fascism is on the rise on a level we haven't seen in more than a generation are there not enough out and proud racists that you feel you need to unmask the my little pony youtuber Jenny next Jenny next Jenny next so do not give me this horseshit about accountability this is obviously just entertainment to you just fucking own it obsessively chronicling every perceived misstep we've ever made that could be interpreted badly all while completely ignoring the rest of our entire bodies of work why are you wasting so much energy on this because you can't impact people who are actually doing your community harm you can't shame the shameless Trump will never face justice Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court for life Ben Shapiro gets off on your outrage so you shame those who can be shamed and if you call one of us bigoted enough times people will start to believe it and then you can feel like you solved racism by spreading lies about a person you have never met and never will and was doing you and your community no harm well done job wash good job fuck every single one of you you do not deserve grace you do not deserve sympathy part 8 the beast so obviously in my case the easy thing to do would be eat crow and move on I never would have gotten trending if I hadn't deleted my twitter account but I'm not here to say a bunch of shit I don't mean because PR fuck PR you want your precious authenticity here it is there's a danger to normalizing the insincere apology and if we normalize acting like PR bots and dole out disingenuous apologies whenever they are demanded for any reason valid or invalid any harm real or imagined then this isn't discourse this is performance the reason campaigns like this gain traction is because they prey on communities that try to operate in good faith they take advantage of people's good will and they condition cynicism so inevitably people harden over they default to skepticism even this fucking woman of color who herringed cat black demanding that she answer for collaborating with such a racist well guess what that person eventually fessed up to being a white man before deleting his account because you know listen to POC people are so obsessed with identity as a rhetorical trump card you can't even take it on good faith that people are who they say they are anymore and they take that desire to do right and exploit it because it makes them feel powerful this is the real mask off your next genny your next Sarah your next Natalie because running women off twitter is fun I mean accountability so militantly performing allyship by rooting out corruption like it's the fucking red scare sharing doctored screenshots of tweets that don't exist and willfully misinterpreting things to prove that the my little pony youtuber is a secret racist deep down you know you're just doing it for cloud right you should be sensitive to marginalized groups and you should be constantly advocating for a more just world and against racism because we all have the stink on us but that should be the goal in itself not performing on twitter so people can reassure you you're one of the good ones so you can get max retweets for an awesome dunk I am not innocent I have done this and his content creators are behavior online turns from due diligence into threat modeling and I'm not playing this game anymore trying to stay 18 steps ahead of the worst possible interpretation of my words or actions isn't taking accountability it's just self defense it's just protecting the brand and I understand why there is this lingering culture of distrust especially among communities of color but it is the height of dishonesty to suggest that the kind of atmosphere where everything is taken in bad faith leads to a more just world I'm not furious because I'm uniquely wronged I will be fine I didn't actually lose anything I could have pretended nothing happened and probably be better off because nobody cares about the fucking riot we I'm furious because this keeps happening and we have deluded ourselves into thinking that savaging each other for the smallest transgression and the most minor disagreement is helping write the wrongs of the world that there's this broad refusal to admit that our systems that operate on good faith are very often abused I was going to include a section about other people for more marginalized groups than me who are held to an even higher standard of purity who have lost way more than I have for equally minor perceived transgressions but you know you probably already know some and they probably don't want me using their names anyway but I feel like I need to impress that I didn't start getting noticeable harassment from the purity tester brigade until I stood up for a trans woman on Twitter over and I cannot express this enough a situation that did not deserve anything approaching the level of outrage that it fostered and that backlash did not come from the alt-right or even the diet Nazis but our own community our side this is why they win a friend of mine named it the beast the name for this fear that we all live under but don't acknowledge and over the last few years I have had so many of my colleagues all of them women people of color trans people queer people are some combination of the above voice to me the constant anxiety that they live with about maybe saying something wrong that will get them on the bad side of their own communities every thought is a hostage situation is this the tweet that's going to sink me so what do we call it what is the name for this unspoken unacknowledged culture of fear where we all know that one misstep can ruin our lives this social media culture where we participate in the public shaming one day and become chained to the pillory the next we can't even talk about it because the beast does not have a name if we admit that this is a problem then the right will just take it and run with it and use it to increase their own power same as they did with cancel same as they did with woke same as they did with fake news if it has a name that it has power so it is a discussion that cannot be had and so we do not have it we say cancel culture doesn't exist and ignore this disease pretend it isn't doing real harm not just to individuals who are targeted but to the state of discourse in general and especially to individuals and marginalized groups because they are always held to the highest standard of purity and they always have the most to lose it isn't even about saying something tone-deference sensitive a mere difference in opinion might get you fired from your job if enough people raised a stink about it and just so we're clear i'm not really even talking about me i will be fine but living under the shadow of the beast makes it hard to just create at all a big factor in why it takes us so long to do a single video is threat modeling because god forbid you say something mildly positive about one of the bad ones that you did not know were bad so much of the work we do is getting ahead of any potential misstep by adding like 1800 caveats and acknowledgements and it's never enough and jelena and i were collaborating with fellow author and essayist jenna in on a video about the live action moulin that jenna was co-writing and was going to co-host and we'd been working on it for months and right after this happened i was like we have to scrap this video but then after a few days i was like for what because a bunch of twitter teens are gonna call me a racist for criticizing a movie nobody likes y'all we're gonna do that either way believe me i know that this video is not going to change any minds it's going to make a lot of people very angry and i hope they get lots of engagement i hope they see i wish you all of the retweets but i can't stay ahead of it anymore i'm not going to do the performance of avoiding offense of staying 500 steps ahead of everything that might be misread or misinterpreted not because it's the right thing to do but just to protect my brand fuck my brand i will do the due diligence but i'm done with threat modeling i just don't care anymore if you want to read bigoted dog whistles and everything i say go with god if you want to pass my list of sins to everyone who so much as mentions me in a positive way i hope it brings you peace if you want to speculate on my private life i hope it brings you much profit i hope you accrue much social capital i personally choose to take a page from the book of my political enemies you can't shame the shameless so i'm going to use the term cancel in its original vernacular meeting i am canceling shame and i will fuck with shame no more forever so if anything thank you for liberating me from giving a fuck part 9 what now i want to acknowledge that i got dozens if not hundreds of messages of support in private through patreon instagram and email and while not all of them were 100% you did nothing wrong i would be remiss not to acknowledge that some of them genuinely made me cry with how kind they were even some of the ones who were critical of what i said were done with a sense of empathy and i'm sorry i didn't respond to most of you but just know i read all of your messages and friendly reminder i will be fine until my liver gives out this is like the 800th time something like this has happened to me but am i done with twitter basically yeah i honestly intended to be forever done with twitter but i was then reminded that i am contractually obligated to promote my books through social contractually obligated preorder link for my second book in the description so i'll still use it for that sort of thing and i will continue using it to you know promote smaller creators and authors when i find something that i think deserve attention and also shameless nepotism it's people calling me a nepotist how dare you say a thing that is true but my biggest mistake was using twitter in the way that a lot of my friends who had way fewer followers than me did like yeah i can be a little edgy i can make jokie jokes i can just be you know i can be like one of the boys and i should have stopped doing that a long time ago worse twitter is just a recipe for both addiction and misery they call it doom scrolling for a reason like even in the last couple weeks i feel like my brain is having to rewire just this impulse to constantly be checking twitter and it was making me a shittier person i was getting in fights with people more and more i was dunking on people more and more i was clapping back at followers more and more like one other person i own apology to his movie bob i told him on twitter to leave me alone because he was acting like a creep by being over familiar and continually signaling to the world that were friends and he he was acting like a creep and we're not friends but i would have never done that if i had known that the diet nazis were gonna turn that into a meme like i don't like a lot of what he says on twitter either but please stop using my face to torture this man leave him alone so at its core this was a wake up call and that is why i deleted my account part and it can happen to you i want to reaffirm that the roots of this doos stem from a rise in anti-Asian racism and that racism is very real as i was writing this video a friend of mine on facebook posted a screen cap of this truly heinous thing that my kukka be said which not only regurgitates this inane conservative garbage about identity politics it completely dismisses the very real wave of hate that is happening in america right now and he posted it with this comment white people please pay attention every day a person of color has to look at something like this or worse every literal day try just try to imagine what that would do to your psyche and it hurt to read and honestly it hurts for me to even read out loud right now because it's true i literally only can imagine few of the people stoking anti-Asian violence right now will suffer consequences and probably more racist attacks will occur and this is just another chapter in our country's long sad history of anti-Asian racism and the reality is there's not a lot we as individuals can do about that we live in a fundamentally unjust world i do acknowledge that and at the beginning anyway a lot of the frustration at the original tweet did stem from that and i don't want to dismiss all public feedback as inevitably harassment i think it's important to retain this nuance lest we always frame the issue of harassment as a blanket condemnation of the public and public feedback but i also cannot stress enough how quickly this whole situation went from valid criticism rooted in real hurt to straight up abuse and not just of me of my friends my colleagues this disease that is twitter enacting the same passion play again and again and again even people who were sympathetic to me they still wanted to attribute the hate to one thing you know one slip of the tongue one bad take one wrong affiliation one wrong tone i took i've seen so many people try to rationalize it even when they think i did nothing wrong but the reality is what gets you on the radar of the mob is nothing a picture a joke a comment just existing as a woman a person of color a woman of color a queer person doing your job one unpopular opinion a poorly aged take being online for too long being associated with the wrong person saying something nice about the wrong person sometimes all it takes is being successful people want to rationalize your mistakes and list them and label them not because it has anything ultimately to do with you it doesn't but because they want to reassure themselves that it will never happen to them that it will never be them on the pillory so even if you don't think i did anything wrong if you can still pin this on a specific error then you can distance yourself and sleep well that you would know better than to make the same mistake and it would never happen to you and that's just not how it works part of what makes twitter so toxic is the sense of hopelessness it engenders you're exposed to this never ending stream of bad news and constant examples of how fucked the world is and reminders that you have the power to affect very little change that compounded with the fact that platforms like twitter rely mostly on shorthand and are constantly encouraging you to produce and encourage knee jerk reactions with very little context means that hopelessness and powerlessness and aggression it's got to go somewhere and on march 26 2021 it got funneled to me and i cannot in good faith say i have not done the same mindlessly joined in on a dog pile on someone who said something stupid or insensitive because it felt good and for a brief moment it gave me a sense of power but then that moment is gone and the world is still shitty and that person's life whatever their infraction was deserved or undeserved is marginally worse for my involvement in it and that is why i'm stepping away so for all of the people who used me as their outlet for their pain and aggression on that crisp spring mourn i understand that you feel hopeless and powerless in an increasingly shitty world and i understand that there is a reason to assume bad faith when so many other people have let you down and the only thing i can do for you is extend the same grace and compassion that you extended to me"
065_Sienna,"I decided to take a month off of social media due to the negativity surrounding my platform. It was honestly one of the most difficult times in my life for many reasons. But through struggle, I found clarity within myself and with who I want to surround myself with. My purpose in this life is to create. And whether that's silly TikTok dances or showing unedited photos of myself, creating and inspiring is what fulfills me. I know that this is why God and the universe have given me this platform. I preach self love but that takes time and patience. Now more than ever, I feel proud of the person that I am. Even if I can only inspire one person, I will have done what I was put on this earth to do. We're all learning and growing. And more than anything, I'm beyond thankful for my family, friends, partnerships and supporters. There's a song by Sam Smith that I think a lot of people in my age can relate to. I hope this can inspire you. I want to be wild and young and not be afraid to lose. But they're watching me, judging me, making me feel so used. Can't you see that all I want to do is get a little wild, get a little high? Kiss a hundred boys and not feel like I'm tied to them. If you wanna judge me, then go and load the gun. I've done nothing wrong, I'm young. Get a little wild, get a little high. Kiss a hundred boys and not feel like I'm tied to them. If you wanna judge me, then go and load the gun. I've done nothing wrong, I'm young."
066_Kay,"I don't have any of those. You have a million dollars tethered somewhere. You made a fucked ton of money, Sam. I'm coming clean about the whole fucking thing. Everything. Start the fucking finish road. Alright, so this is against all legal advice that I've gone. The last thing I posted was a script. It was actually made for me by lawyers. I've been having to bite my tongue for this whole month while we collect all the evidence. And that's what's messing up the most, man. Not being able to come out and just talk. And finally now today, I'm able to do that. Before I start, I want to say that I would never in a million years on purposely, intentionally try to harm, take advantage or scam anybody. I am no crypto mastermind, alright? I'm literally a content creator and I trusted the wrong people and it's led to this disaster that I'm in. But I also want to say that I am genuinely so sorry that any of this ever happened. It was never my intention. And if I could take it back, I would instantly in a heartbeat. You guys, my fans have helped me build a life I have today and I feel terrible that anybody was affected like the shit eats me up. Even though I was tricked by somebody that took advantage of me and my fanbase, I'm committed to paying as many people back as possible out of my own pocket. I feel awful that this ever happened and I just want to do everything I can to help fix it. But I'll chat to you guys more about that at the end of the video with all the information. Over the last month, we've been gathering huge amounts of evidence and we've made some actual shocking discoveries. It's been very hard and complex to unravel. But ultimately, a friend of mine, somebody that I trusted stabbed me in the back in a way that I never could have expected. But before we get into that, I want to address some of the things that people don't know. First of all, I know I said this in my last video. I didn't make money, but I'm going to exactly break down to you how I lost $37,000 on Save the Kids. So let's start here with all of my wallets and transactions on Save the Kids. I have nothing to hide. I'm showing you guys everything for full transparency. So people have alleged that I sold for pure profit and then abandoned the project when this is just false. I have costs going out days and weeks afterwards for the pure purpose of trying to help the project. For example, two hours after Save the Kids was launched, I sent $55,000 of my own money and this was for one single purpose. If you're familiar with crypto, this website is a place where you go to check out all of the tokens, the graphs, everything like that. And on the front page of it, they have a vetted section where there's a bunch of tokens and everything up there has to be checked for security. The code's got to be checked. All of that and that is exactly what the $55,000 was for. You can see behind me, all of the screenshots, all of the transactions, everything. But that's just one of the costs that I have incurred. I was paying for everything and anything, like team members donating the iPads to the schools, getting put on more of these exchanges and listings and things like that. It was the actions of one individual that caused the entire project to not be able to sustain itself, which was the original plan. And guys, don't get me wrong. I'm not looking for any sympathy. I'm only showing you my loss so you can see that I didn't profit on Save the Kids. So like if I was really abandoning this project, why would I spend $55,000 as my own money and more on things that legitimize this and make it a long time sustainable thing? Like it literally doesn't make sense. And there's a wallet that I have that nobody knows about that still has every Save the Kids in it and I didn't sell a single one. So if I was focused on profit, then why did I not sell that? And it's because I was committed to this project long time, we thought we would be able to donate and give things through my videos. There was a bunch of charity tokens that were really successful and we thought we could do the same. And to think I would participate in a rug pool that has my face on it, it's kind of like saying, you know, hey, I'm gonna go and rob a bank without wearing a mask and expect not to get caught. There's no way I would put my brother and my friends' reputations on the line as well, especially when, you know, I have my friends and family and people I love who are invested and have their money in this. Like why would I fuck them over? It just doesn't make any sense. So I wanna talk about my friends and brother for a minute. So Jarvis, he only sold really weeks after to try and pay me back for the loss that I had. During all of this going on, he's preparing for his fight, training 8, 9, 10 hours a day. He had no idea what was going on and trusted me to do everything. So moving on, Nikon, he made zero dollars. He only sold the amount that he put in, meaning he didn't make anything. Tico, Tico lost all of his money. He put money in, he even put a bit more in after it went out and lost all of that too. He didn't sell a single thing. But there was one person that did make money and that is claiming to have not made anything and is lying to his so-called friends. And you're probably wondering why or how this ever even happened. So it all started when numerous people and they cracked our space, which is talking to me and my personal team and saying, you know, hey, I'll be really cool if influencers were the face of this project that Rudy gave back and made a difference. So I was on board with the idea and we helped start the token. I'd take four responsibility for that. And obviously I had zero knowledge about how to make anything like this. So I was fully reliant on the tech team. We're gonna have to take a step back for a second and speak about somebody that was key in all of this and that is Sam Pepper. And I support, save the kids, save the kids, save the kids. Sam was somebody that I trusted to help with this token. I met Sam around four years ago when I moved into Banks' house. He was deep in the creative scene of LA and I found myself hanging out with him more and more. Sam was hired by face for a short time as their head of content, this led me to being around him more and more. But that didn't last for long as my YouTube channel back then was blowing up. He quickly saw an opportunity for himself, I guess, and left them and convinced me to give him a percentage of my YouTube revenue in returns for being the brains of my content and doing everything. I was getting very stressed about the amount of work that I had to do in all of my videos and I was literally doing everything so I thought he would be able to alleviate some of that. Basically how it worked is I would give Sam an idea and then he goes and takes the idea and runs with it and basically does everything and all the work. And this quickly developed into him handling a lot more than just my videos but just like all of my other business affairs. Sam is the person that introduced me to all of this crypto. Without him, I wouldn't be in this position. I'm in today and I would not be making this video. There was the initial NFT craze a few months ago where all of a sudden he got really obsessed with it. I started making money on that and it diverged all of his attention away from me when I was still obviously paying him. This is something that I address with people as you can see on the screen behind. I was talking about that. I was worried about all of this because obviously all I focused on and my only goal is to make content and make videos. That's all I do. And it was Sam who was expressing interest over the next few months and weeks wherever of me and my friends coming together and being a part of a project that he does. So finally when it came to save the kids, I trusted Sam to give the jitter my advice and do proper decisions because he presented himself this whole time as an expert. He is way more knowledgeable about crypto than I am and is already involved in every other aspect of my life. So if I'm succeed, Sam is to succeed. I had no way thought he would have a fuck me over and his so-called friends, my family. And most importantly, all of my fans. Trusting him obviously now I realize was a massive mistake. He took charge without anyone's permission and started to make all of the decisions. His control and power influenced the main dev who literally felt obliged to do what Sam said. Sam helped design the token, the art for the token, the website for the token and fill the pre-sale and he made all of the decisions that led to this current situation. This is a clip of him directing us for the promotional video that you've all seen. It was completely his idea and vision. My name's Kay. My name's Jarvis. Nico. Tico. We's not. No. And we support. I support and I support. Save the kids. Save the kids. Now a few weeks into the creation of the token, Sam and I's relationship very much has started to deteriorate. We have just moved into the same house from California to Las Vegas. This was a very stressful time for me as I was trying to pool together our new face house, make all of their content as well as the same time as doing mine and Jarvis' videos. I think it equated to something like 16 videos per week I was making. And obviously, save the kids was an interesting project but still my time and my focus is all just YouTube. I had never lived with Sam before and to be honest, I was hating it. He's a very intense person to be around 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but ultimately felt like I had no choice because I had just moved from California to Las Vegas, done all of this work to live in this house. So I was just kind of going to accept it. These problems got a lot worse and it actually led to me letting Sam know that once we got back from the UK that he wouldn't be working for me anymore, it was very complicated as I have a lot of videos to deliver on so I had to find a replacement in the meantime to help me with all of that. We had already booked a trip to Miami for Jarvis' fights so we agreed to work on everything up until the point that I left. You know, it was very clear to me that he was putting in zero time into my videos and anything to do with what I was doing and all of his attention was on cryptocurrency. More than this, multiple people have told me that apparently Sam's plan all along was to make $1 million in however, in cryptocurrency and then disappear. And this is very important with what happens next. At this point, it's clear Sam doesn't care about me or my reputation and he has no problem with breaking my trust and scamming thousands of people. So next up, I'm gonna speak about what happened to the anti-well measure and everything I'm about to say has been investigating and looked at by numerous blockchain detectives. I wanna reiterate the fact that I have no technical background or knowledge. So the goal essentially was to have a system that stopped these wells, the owner large percent of the token from dumping it all immediately. Sam insisted the devs to make the change to the well code. His reasoning at the time was that the people in the pre-sell wouldn't be able to sell enough of their tokens. It was completely Sam's idea to make this change and it would only be revealed later on in our investigation as to why he did that. There is a behind the scenes manager who mainly pushed this and this was Sam's pushing trying to argue with the devs that the code should have been changed so it was a lot less limiting. Originally it was argued down to being 10 minutes but then it was eventually a state of that. They just wanted it to be one minute. The devs reminded that they were contracted so eventually we had to concede and make that change. Needless to say, Sam's actions had devastating consequences for the launch. More than that, we found two of Sam's wallets which show that he made just roughly $70,000 in around 24 hours. I confronted him about this. He denied it all. I have recordings that I'm gonna play. I even confronted Sam. I asked him, I was like, yo, man, please can you come clean on all of the shit that you've done? Like I'm finding this all out right now. My life is falling apart, I've been kicked from phase and he just refused to take any accountability for any of it. I had no idea that you actually made money, bro. No, I didn't make money. No, no. Hold on to that. Just showing me, you've made $50,000, $40,000, bro. On my main ones, I had two pre-stales and on both of them, I lost nearly that. I think I lost 40. And then I put over 15 into mods. I know Sam was going to bride in all the mods and they were left not being paid, which I know that the mods got taken care of by UK, you were on the same thing, the B&B to actually cover them for their modding. He then later in another call, when I asked him, changed his story and said, oh, maybe I did make a bit of money. I can't be more than like 5 B&B of anything. I got my initial out, that was it. I got what I put in. He was denying even owning or having access to any of these wallets, which obviously if you have a wallet, if you have something, it's on the blockchain forever, it doesn't just delete, it doesn't hide. I don't have any wallets. So I'm editing this right now and Sam is once again tweeting about buying NFTs with his crypto when apparently he doesn't own any wallets. We can see his wallet story is literally got hundreds of thousands of dollars. He must be hiding something to lie to me about this. He just can't stop contradicting himself as you'll see in the next clip too. And then show me your wallets, but right now, all the proof I have is that you made a fuck ton of money, Sam. No, I did that. Bro, Sam, then help me help you then, all right? Help me help you, but right now it looks like you made a fuck ton of money, bro. And you lied to me and said you didn't. And that's what's hurting me the most. What hurts me the most is that you lied, bro. I'm telling you I didn't make a fuck ton of money, babe. I mean, then just then go and get the proof and then send it to me, please. How'd you work? How'd you work out? I have to. I'd Sam, you think I'd Sam, you know the most about all of this stuff, bro, don't say that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I guess I have to look each transaction and add up all the B&B and then see how much adds up to, right? Mate, you know exactly how to do this, Sam. Sam, you know what the fuck happened, bro. And I have nothing to hide at this point. And if you don't have anything to hide, then show me. Because I'm coming clean about the whole fucking thing. Everything, start the fucking finish, bro. So, all of this is shocking enough but we did find way more. During the start of our investigation, the main developer found a sheet called the Sam Pepper whitelist. And on it is a list of people that he's responsible for bringing into the presale. You know, with everything going on, we thought this document might re-hold some clues after all Sam's reason for changing the well code was that people in the presale wouldn't be able to sell enough of their tokens. So the ownership of this document, as you can see, comes back to a strange name called Spung Finance. We still don't know who that is, but we know that Sam was the one that created this document. There are even jokes on the side of it where they're kidding and laughing about certain times where they're gonna dump the token. This was on Sam's list that he brought in. And the biggest concern and what we've really found out and what led us down a deeper rabbit hole was that if you type in all of these Twitter names on the left, half of them are fake, not even red accounts, who even knows if these accounts ever existed. So the people that Sam are trying to verify have real people putting money into the presale are in fact fake people that don't exist. Currently, it's looking extremely likely that these wallets were owned by one single person. So that means that one individual owned 12.24% of the total supply, which is obviously insane. They then proceeded to dump these tokens almost immediately due to the well code that Sam had changed. More than that, the blockchain detectives that I hired over the past few weeks have found reasonable evidence that suggests that many of these wallets connect back to Sam himself, meaning that he would technically be that one big individual owner. One of his public wallets, which is known to be this, has been connected to another wallet, which is also without a doubt his. We know this because he sent funds back and forth from Sam's public wallet. Multiple times interacting with it in different ways. This wallet then received payments from several other people that Sam brought into the presale. And again, quote unquote people, I don't know who they are or if they are just Sam himself. It's very clear that we have a control of these was moving funds across to many other wallets to make it look like they weren't owning as much of the tolls applied that they actually did. And their transactions were also in classes of the same small amount further proving that this was one person. So we've added up the total profit from these wallets and it's insane amount, $33,643. This is how much it looks like Sam made. So I obviously confronted Sam and asked him about these wallets and he denied it. I'll play the clip. Like I don't have my wallet I brought into the presale with. I don't have it. He was at the point in this conversation where everything he just said was a lie. He told me, and I'm gonna play it to you guys. He told me that he doesn't own any cryptocurrency. Not one cent. When we all know, Sam Pepper is a millionaire from cryptocurrency. That's basically like saying that you don't own a bank account that you don't have any money to your name. But in fact, everybody knows he does. I can look at his wallets. I told like I text you on like, I'm obviously not gonna fuck with crypto. You don't have any wallets bro. You are Sam. You are just lying to me right now, bro. I'm sorry mate. You are, this is insane. You're not gonna lie to me and say, you have no cryptocurrency to your name. You have a million dollars tethered somewhere. I'm telling you the fact that I did not make pure onto your account. Then he proof. I'm about to give them all the proof that they need. You need to give me some proof. At least you could do the decency is to not lie to me straight to my face like this. He then really freaked out later on in the conversation when I said to him that I was gonna be exposing and sharing all of this information. You're gonna guess so this is gonna be crazy when you've released people's wallets. What do you mean just for me? What exactly do you mean by that? I thought people, I feel like what people are gonna do. A day after launch, Sam had ceased all communication with key team members on Save the Kids. It was like he was pretending this never happened. He didn't care that my face was on it. My brother's face was on it. That my friends faces weren't it. That thousands of people have been affected. He was just gonna pretend nothing had ever happened and move on with his life normally. And just you and I were hearing this from me. Here's another member that worked on the project that would explain it from his perspective. So my first question is that people think that I really quickly abandoned this project. Yeah, like that's just not true at all anyway, shape or form. You were probably one of the only members of the team who stayed behind throughout everything. Well, most team members wouldn't even reply. I mean, you were there calling me on a daily basis to discuss ideas and potential marketing plans for the project. If we ever discussed an idea and we both liked it, you would send me the funds without any hesitation to proceed on that, all that idea. And these were just small sums of money. They were for five-day or something. And then obviously I did just speak about how Sam like just abandoned everything basically. Yeah, I mean, Sam won from being a huge he-stone in the project every day leading multiple people from the mods to the art team to other people involved. Just going completely ghost and even when I tried to reach out to him and never even responded to me, but he clearly read my messages. I told him that we were doing for the project and asked him to come back and he just left me on the red. So after Sam stopped all communication with the dev team, he then started ghosting all of his friends, which made me extremely suspicious. So as I was in the UK, I hired a trusted security guard to go and stay at our shared house in Vegas because I know how crazy Sam is, but what he saw shocked me. All right, so I'm on the phone right now with the private security guard that I hired when I knew that Sam was going back to our shared house in Vegas and I wanted him to basically re-account everything that happened over there if you could. I was in the house, assisting him with some of his items. And I noticed kind of Sam was in the house kind of moving frankly. What's working on getting his items out of the house as well. He just was kind of walking on a nervous behavior when they were packing. They had gotten a u-haul and they're back and forth from the vehicles, stores and stuff. And they left very fast and they didn't say that they're leaving or anything like that. They just left the house without saying, yeah, I'd, I'd feel like that. Their room was how they say still, 90% full of their stuff. Which is completely full of clothes still. Mate, yeah. Left all of his briefcases there, safe. Surely he could have fit them all in the u-haul truck though, right? The u-haul truck that he did get would have completely fit everything in there. Instead of packing all the u-haul, it packed, I guess, there's what they considered maybe their central items. They left. So it just kind of shows that they left quickly because there was some way that happened. Yeah, and what you said earlier as well about like, obviously you were staying in the house, but at nighttime Sam didn't even sleep in there, you said. They were just in their room, confining the room. But I guess I was sooner packing up. He was coming back to the house with like MacBooks and stuff, not really communicating with us. I had obviously, I don't know if you know this as well, but I saw online two, Sam's sold his Tesla, that Tesla, the white one, he sold it. That just shows like he had to do it out of your fast, going back overseas, you know, that's overnight basically. Yeah, he's not able actually, like once he leaves the US, he's like, he's like left forever, like he can't actually go back. So guys, I'm editing this right now. We've been working so hard on this video and we have just found the final piece of the puzzle. Sam's $1 million wallet. He does everything possible to try and hide where he sends his money, but we finally tracked it down. He cares more about this $1 million figure than anything else. It was his only goal all along. It's all he's cared about and I hope reaching his normal was worth losing all of his friends over. And once again, as you heard earlier, this is somebody who said he doesn't own any wallets. So now the world can see. I would never be seen, associated or working with Sam Pepper, ever again, it's very clear that his actions caused an incredible amount of damage and ultimately he only has his own interests at heart. Now, I really want to apologize about being led by somebody that I should not have trusted so much. I should have invested more of my time into really understanding what went on instead of relying on others. And for this, I hold my hands up. Save the kids was not charity fraud. Everything about the token was completely transparent and laid out on the website before the launch. There is a 3% transaction fee. 1% is a liquidity pool. 1% is the holders. And the other 1% goes to the charity. This is an automatic process that is coded into the project from the very start. The charity that saved the kids donated to was called Binance Lunch for Children. This charity donates lunches and meals to less fortunate children in Africa. Right now, the tokens are a value to be approximately $34,000. And on the night of launch, they were valued to be around $140,000. And as you can see, everything was donated and has been from the very start. So people have questioned the coins that I previously spoke about on my Twitter and I'd like to explain this. So I started out with trading these tokens like Dogecoin and SafeBeard. There was so much talk about them on Twitter and the mainstream media was covering them. Talking about how people were turning into millionaires overnight. And on any of those coins that I was trading or buying as a hobby, I was never the owner or the creator. Nothing premeditated like that. I just wanted to see what it was all about at the start. So after that is when tokens started to really approach me and my team. One reason why I was really happy to state my support for some tokens was the fact that it was given back to you guys through giveaways. Throughout my whole career, I've loved doing giveaways to my followers. Literally things from PS5s to Amazon gift cards to money, thousands of dollars, everything and anything. I have given back to you guys. It's always been a key part of my brand and it makes me really happy to do it. I genuinely at the time didn't think that there was anything wrong with it. A big part of what I do is brand deals and they get brought to me by various people. And I treated these tokens just like any other company I work with. Me personally, I have declined the huge gambling deals I've declined, proing only fans goes to you guys. So you go and buy their stuff, things that I just don't want to expose you guys to. And I guess because I was trading it at the time and they offered me these big giveaways, I thought it made sense. It was the first time that the influencer and crypto space have collided like this and I was never aware of the negative impact it can have. You know, there were huge celebrities doing the same thing and I think it's fair to say now that everybody's learned a lot. Guys, I gave away roughly $70,000 to random people in little over a month. Here are the literal countless screenshots of the transactions, of the conversations, everything with all of these people where you can see how grateful they are to receive these tokens. It's surprisingly time consuming to select people and make sure they are real or not about message them and send them their winnings. Often these people as you can see, don't speak English, they're very new to crypto, ask loads of questions about wallets, but despite this, we spent many hours making sure all of the winners received their prizes. If any mistakes were made by us, it was just an honest error. Why would I ever fake giving away a few thousand dollars when amongst all of that, I'm legitimately giving away tens of thousands of dollars and then even amongst all of that in my career, I've given away way over six figures of money to random people, man, like that literally doesn't make any sense. So it's come to my attention that one giveaway out of all of them was missed and this is a $500 giveaway to a single person. So as you can see, I winner was selected in this document at the time. This was the only occasion where the funds were never transferred and it's likely due to a simple miscommunication with my team. I rely on my assistants to go on my computers and do everything while I'm out busy filming, working, all of that. Now this guy has been contacted and paid four times the original prize that he won. All I can say is that I'm sorry that this one giveaway got missed, but to think I would try and cut corners on a $500 giveaway when I'm really giving away tens of thousands of dollars, $70,000, it just doesn't make sense. So I just want to say I've spent 10 years in this space and never been involved in any kind of drama. I think that anybody that does know me knows that this is not a reflection of the person that I am. I lost a lot from this and it's not just the business, but friends, you know, I want to say sorry to everybody, man, sorry to my fans and anybody that I actually let down. I want to say sorry to a long list of people, man, phase, banks, Jarvis, T-code, Nikon, Summer and Rice. This experience has been the biggest regret and reset of my entire life. And I want you to know that I'm going to be completely changing my lifestyle moving forward. The original Frazier that started doing all of this didn't care about the money or the clothes, the designer, all of that fake bullshit stuff. Now that I know doesn't make me happy, I guess at some point in my journey, I really did get lost and it's taking something like this for me to realize what actually matters. Now looking back at it, I've been playing this phase K character for quite some time now and at some point, it really did get out of hand and it was not me anymore. I just want to go back to being the real Frazier, so I'm going to be taking this time to go back to my roots and just work on myself for a while. So as I mentioned at the start of the video, I will help as many of you as I can. Right now there is no way of knowing who lost what, and saved the kids. So if you did, please send me your wallet address that you use to buy the token to the email down below with as much information as possible so we can reach out to you and help you fix this. Besides all of that, my crypto money is going to be donated, which you'll see in my upcoming video. And that's just a tiny fraction of what we've got planned despite everything that's happened. You know, I am excited for the next chapter and I can't wait for you guys to join me. So take you easy, everybody, and I'll see you when I'm back."

068_Noris," Nora's not fashion, we did find this with passion. Nora's not fashion. So lots of people have been saying in the comments of the strike challenge video that we posted, saying I've been cheating and everything, like looking at the screen. I know some of you had been saying that I cheat too by not wiping off my strike when I raged before.

069_Gus," Hi everyone, I'm sorry I didn't make this video sooner. I stepped away from social media for the last three months to really reevaluate everything that's going on in my life right now and I'm here to talk to you today about everything that's been happening. A few months ago, my ex-girlfriend posted a video that talked about a very difficult and painful experience that we went through in a relationship together over three years ago. It dealt with an unexpected pregnancy that turned out to be a topic and the subsequent long recovery process that followed and I just want to talk to you about that time today. I think that during that time I was so close to the situation that I was not able to fully realize and understand the pain that my partner was going through and I was not able to fully understand the impact that I had on that situation. I think that I was so caught up in my own overwhelming fear of what was going on that it made it difficult for me to see through that to really connect with and understand her sense of fear. As the medical situation continued to last for many months with no end in sight, I just... there were just times that I just said some stupid stuff and some things that just caused my partner additional hurt. I think that I set these things to inflate my own sense of righteousness because I felt so drained from the situation and I was so afraid of what was to come and there didn't seem like there was any end in sight. I think I got to the point where I had convinced myself that I was doing everything that I could do and that I was saying everything that I should say. I thought that I was doing everything right and it just became frustrating and I felt so defeated and it took me a while to realize that I was actively making the situation worse and adding additional hurt and that realization has just left me feeling so foolish and ashamed. This medical situation happened over three years ago and we continued to date for a few more years after that happened and during those few years we talked about this medical time a lot and we sought couples therapy together and individual therapy and this was discussed at length. I think that it just took me a while to really realize my shortcomings during this time and the impact that I had on my partner in this terrible period and how my words and actions made the situation worse and that was something that was hard to realize and just made me feel very foolish and remorseful for my behavior at certain periods during that time. One thing that's been made clear to me is that I have a tendency to just kind of shut down and shut off and shut out during times of crisis. I think that when stuff goes wrong, historically I've just been somebody that thinks, all right, well I'm going to grab the wheel. I'll take care of this, I'll get in, I'll make the decisions and I'll help everybody, I'll get everyone out of this situation. And I've just realized over the last few years especially that that is not a very positive way to tackle every situation and that leads to people just feeling left out and disrespected and steamrolled and it was a struggle for me to identify that and that is something that I've just been trying to work on and just rework in myself during these difficult periods. My partner and I split up a few months ago and I'm glad that she's finding a new sense of self and I'm really glad that she feels comfortable sharing this story as part of her healing journey and I hope she keeps doing it. I just feel so foolish for the shortcomings that I brought forth during this time and I just feel incredibly regretful for just the dumb stuff that I said. I'm sorry that I caused her hurt during this time and I'm sorry that I was not the partner that she needed during this really difficult period and the hurt is extended beyond that. There are a number of people who engage with my content or who I work with professionally that have been negatively affected as a result of my actions and my words and I just would like to extend my sincerest apologies to these people as well. I hate disappointing people and I want my pages and platforms to be a place where folks can come to get a little bright spot of happiness and get distracted from a lot of the negativity that's going on and I'm so sorry for disappointing for so many people. I really am. I hope that my former partner can use this moment in time to heal and find some peace and I wish her the best."
070_MatPat,"Hello internet! Welcome to the couch video that I never expected that we'd have to make. I am literally headed out the door and to the airport in like 45 minutes, but I felt like I needed to sit down on the couch and address a very important issue that I've seen come up in the last 48 hours. I guess by the time this video goes live might be closer to 72. We're gonna try to get this out the door as fast as possible. But anyway, very recently since our last episode, a few days ago we posted this latest episode about our good old buddy FNAF. Discussing the latest book in the series Felix the Shark. Not a particularly great book, but also not the worst in the series. Looking through this book we found several details that I thought were pretty darn interesting. Clues that seem to be pointing towards the existence of some sort of FNAF air-g that never got off the ground, or maybe was hidden out there in the ether that no one had actually stumbled across yet. So in that video I asked you the FNAF fan base and fellow theorists to look into the game files of the FNAF 3 mobile game port because that was explicitly mentioned in novel. Or to any locals of towns that were mentioned in the book itself to let us know if we had maybe missed something about the geography of these local towns. At least that was my intention in making this video. I mean, air-g's happen all the time and we've covered them before in episodes like the inscription series or Wilbur suits air-g so why would this one be any difference? Over the years, you as the community have dug up all kinds of clues for us and so I was hoping hey our collective hive mind would be able to do it again. I figured that people who knew the history of the franchise and this channel would act in a safe and responsible way when it came to looking into something like this and admittedly millions of you did. There are millions of views on that video and the vast majority of you either just watched it and kind of let it circulate through a YouTube feed or you know you maybe dug through a couple of game files, whatever. Unfortunately a few hundred of you, it's hard to gauge the actual numbers of this thing but whatever the number was too many. Some people actually called the actual places of businesses in the towns that were referenced in the book. According to our subreddit, one place of business actually received enough annoying phone calls that they actually had to shut off their phones. See this? This is me internally screaming right now. Just to be absolutely crystal clear beyond a reasonable doubt, stop. Please stop. I don't know if you can tell but I was not expecting this and honestly this issue caught all of us off guard. I never wanted or intended anyone to bother real people and it's never ever acceptable to harass an individual or a place of business. Period and a story. And here's the thing, I don't think most of you were intending this even if you were calling these places up but consider this. You are a single person researching an online mystery but if say a hundred other people researching that same online mystery all call the same phone number asking the exact same question, yeah, that's going to get bad in a hurry. So this is me formally saying to those business owners, those members of the community individuals who may have felt harassed or burdened by this, I am sorry. I am so so sorry. It was never my intention to cause issues for people or businesses. And again, to the loyal theorists watching this video, stop. Cannot make that clear enough. I appreciate your enthusiasm but this is not the way to do things. It is never, never acceptable to call someone or their place of business to look for lore in a video game and never, ever, ever post addresses or phone numbers. Even for publicly listed businesses, it's just not appropriate. And as someone who's had to endure that level of harassment in the past, it is not something that I would ever wish on anyone. It's totally inappropriate for anyone but especially this community, the game theorist community, which I consider to be smart and respectful. So even if you mean well, just stop. I appreciate it, but now is the time to call this one off. So now that we've gotten the most important message out there into the universe, I want to lay a few solutions for the future because just addressing the issue here doesn't really get down to the root of the problem or how we can prevent this moving forward because here's the thing. I love airgies. You clearly love airgies. They are some of the most fun content that we get to cover on these channels. I mean, even food theory got itself a freaking airgie with Omega Mars. And we are going to keep covering them like we've done many times in the past with inscription and fortnite. This whole time I keep asking myself what happened here. If we had done an episode on the Gravity Falls airgie back when that was still going on, which I even call out in the video in question, with things have been different because that Gravity Falls airgie also required people to share clues online and act as a global community. It required them to go to real world locations to find real world treasure. And let's be honest, if anything, airgies are becoming more mainstream because everything from classic science fiction to sitcom seems like it has an airgie coming out. We, as I said, channels whose whole stick is to talk about mysteries and video games, TV and movies need to be able to discuss these sorts of things happening in the media around us. That's when the solution hit me. There's no protocol in place. We've never been taught officially the rules and etiquette of doing an airgie, a puzzle that crosses from the online world into the real world. And this FNAF airgie just wound up being the first one that a lot of you were exposed to. And hopefully, maybe you just weren't aware of the etiquette of solving these sorts of puzzles. etiquette that is built in with the express purpose of avoiding these sorts of problems that happen when the internet and the real world collide. There are great ways to make airgies, but there are equally great ways to solving airgies. So how do we move forward in a safe way? Education. Talking openly about this and just coming up with a written list of stuff that we all just have an inherent understanding that we follow. I honestly think that the vast majority of people out there who were calling up places of business or looking for clues in real life were doing so earnestly. They had no ill intent. They were just not realizing that this was out of bounds to call a place of business to ask them about a video game. It was wrong, but that's a far cry from malicious. They didn't know the rules of these sorts of games, so I want to make it very clear that if and when we reference airgies on the channel, that there is going to be a clear set of guidelines that every single person should be aware of and follow. I'll actually reference this video many times if we ever do something like this in the future. We've never had this sort of issue come up in the past, but now that it's here, it's time that we move forward as responsible human beings. We set expectations for ourselves, our community, and hopefully for the wider internet. And I'm doing this right here on the channel instead of posting this as a bulleted list on Reddit or on Twitter, mostly because I want to make sure that all of you who saw that original video have the best shot possible of seeing this video as well. To make it very clear that our first priority as an online community as theorists and as puzzle solvers is to act safely and responsibly. And if you think that we've missed anything here, like I said, we kind of rushed through this, everyone on the team kind of brainstormed this very quickly, but please put it down in the comments. We'll add it to the official list. First and absolutely most importantly, never ever ever publish someone's private information online. Even if you think there's the slightest remoteest possibility that it could be associated with an air G, that is called doxing and is probably the biggest internet wide no no period. End of story, spoiler alert, there are going to be no clues in there. Rule two, and associated with that last point, stick to publicly available information, no hacking or uncovering something that involves accessing private information about a person or business. I know it's exciting. Air Gs feel like this big exciting mystery and it's like, I'm living out my hacker fantasies, but remember, there are games that are meant to be played with the public, so keep them in the public sphere. Rule number three, some air Gs, including very famous ones like the Gravity Falls Air G, will require you to go to real world locations or some representative of your puzzle solving team to go to a real world location. These will almost always, in fact, they should always be public spaces and places that do not require you to interact with a person, go on to any private property or otherwise disturb someone else's life. Be safe in these situations regardless of any evidence that you might see. Never go to a place that you wouldn't feel comfortable going to in everyday life, never enter private property, and yes, that abandoned warehouse or old pizza real or whatever is private property. It is not acceptable for you to go there. Or, you know, another shorthand for this is if you've ever been to an escape room, they say the same thing. The clues are going to be obvious. They're going to be in front of you. Do not break stuff to try and find a hidden clue. There is no hidden clue and all you would have done is broken stuff. Rule number four, things like business addresses and phone numbers are, indeed, listed online publicly. And so talking about them is technically not doxing important distinction to make, but it's not okay to call those private businesses about anything other than doing business with them. If you're calling dominoes, make sure you're calling dominoes for some delicious pizza and not asking them whether they belong to the Freddie Fazbear's Pizza Rea universe. If you're doing it, assume that a handful of other people is doing it. And while one phone call might not constitute harassment, a couple hundred phone calls does. Whether that's intentional or not. And finally, rule number five, which is kind of a corollary of rule number four, find one central place to solve ARG's so people aren't trying to repeatedly do the same stuff. Find your like-minded group of puzzle solvers and theorists. You night together, read it, discord, great places to do this sort of thing, but taking over unrelated boards or spaces to dig into an ARG, not okay. It should go without saying, but we would never cover an ARG on this channel that involved violating any of those sorts of guidelines. It's true. Sometimes we may not have all the steps of an ARG pre-solve when we publish a video because we think it's a fun mystery that's fun to solve together as a community. That said, there is no lore, no interesting animatronic discovery that would be worth violating anyone's privacy or disrespecting other people in the real world or online. I hope that we can all move forward doing things that are this exciting, but more importantly, safe. Again, really didn't see this one coming, especially given our long history of covering ARG's, but hey, now that it's here, it's incredibly important to me that this community be a place where we stay responsible. So again, I am so sorry to everyone and anyone who's been affected by this whole thing. Until the rest to be watching, I appreciate you taking the time to watch this. Please, if you know someone who saw that original video, but might not have seen this one, send it over to them. Very important that everyone gets this message across. It wasn't a game theory, but this one was an important video for the theorist community and to all other aspiring puzzle solvers out there. So thank you for watching. Stay safe and as always, stay curious."
071_Miia,"to sync the audio. Oh my god. Okay. Immediately starting to be fucking weird. Okay. It's better to just goddamn start. Hello everyone. Haya, what the fuck? Okay. This video is something that I... It's obviously very different to the videos I'm used to making at least these days, but I feel like it's the right thing to do. And I'm almost like rushing past this intro. Intro, if you can call it, if you can call it because I'm... Oh my god. I'm just getting fucking bluster a shit. I think it's better to just actually start and kind of get into it. So what kind of prompted this, first of all? I want to say is actually got a Tumblr question. A Tumblr question. And somebody asked me, why did you delete all of your old videos? And I... I was kind of at a crossroads, if that makes sense, where I knew what the right thing to do was, and I knew that I was capable of doing it, but I have always gone the other way, you know? So I just decided like, what the fuck? It's not the fucking right thing to do to keep turning this way. It's just be honest. Just be fucking honest. So I said and I answered the question and I think there was that feeling of shame and embarrassment that I was almost well very evidently evading for many years. More of a story, I realized that I text post. God, this sounds so corny already. You know, I already have my own and probably people who are watching too. Pre-this-positioned beliefs about, I mean, I guess you can kind of categorize this into the whole subgenre that is apology videos, but you almost have to take it with a little bit of a grain of salt. At least I do, because when you're making videos, it's like, I mean, you have to press record, not to like fucking over-explain it, but you know, there's a lot of waiting and it's processing and you have to, you know, you practice, you know, there's a little bit of that manufactured like, is this even genuine? And I think, you know, I don't want to be, this is really going to be really convoluted by the way and all over the place in Scatterbrain. Apologies in advance for all the people who get annoyed, because usually my videos are very cut and, you know, to the point, as to the point is they can be at least, anyways, sorry, what the fuck was I going to say? Yeah, I don't want this to, you know, I want to be fucking honest, which is very ironic, considering what I just said about the whole manufactured thing. But I want to have this conversation because I think what I've done for a long time is just run and run and run and run and run and hide and run and run and run and fucking hide and hide and hide and I don't feel like it's appropriate to do that anymore. And that's also intentionally and also subconsciously both a combination of both running away from the consequences and holding myself accountable and being responsible. And that's what I want to do. I don't want to make, um, sweeping shit under the rug as a part of who I am, let alone as a part of what the fuck I put out into the world. And that's why I want to talk about this because it's important. It's um, real shit. You know, sometimes I get the feeling that it's just fucking social media who gives a shit, but I'm really just downplaying how much it matters to me, how much of these things that I'm going to discuss, I'm downplaying maybe how much they hurt me, how much they hurt other people, and I don't want to do that anymore. I want to do the right thing. So forgive me again. Very ironic to say that once again. Apologies in advance because this is going to be a little convoluted and it might not make sense at certain points, but I really just want to do this and get it out there and do the goddamn right thing. So this humbler question, going back to that. The first thing I want to talk about is, you know, the past videos that I used to upload. So I'm pretty sure if you didn't watch me during that time, I know a lot of people found out who I was and this channel, my channel, um, maybe within the past year, year and a half, two years, because I switched the type of content that I did do into social commentary, commentary in general. And before that, there was this story time era on YouTube. I'm pretty sure everybody fucking knows about that, but for those of you who don't, it was around the time that people like Tanemozjo and Simply Nessa rose to fame. I'm not just trying to name drop them to bring them into the conversation, by the way, just for context. It's essentially just you, it's in the name, I guess, like you tell a story during an allocated time. And so this crossroads that I was at, um, I've kind of done this thing. It's, you know what, it's not pretty. I don't know why I'm trying to make it like, um, I have a problem with compulsive and pathological line. And I don't even know how to follow that up. I almost want to say like, yep, now's the time to be defensive. Um, it's not pathological because you know why it and where it came from, but, um, simple as that, I just have a problem with that had and also have because, um, I'm finally coming clean. So I think it's still a part of my persona and who I am and how I carry myself out, etc, etc. Um, it all kind of started when I first made my channel. I lived in Dubai and it was, um, in the beginning, I just thought why not make some little videos and then, you know, there's a certain era that the algorithm, you know, the algorithm likes to pick up on certain, I guess, like trends and telling stories and story times were the thing. That was the thing at the time. And so I first started off by telling real stories about my concert experiences and things that I did. But then I remember the first lie that I ever told was this entire fabricated story about fighting someone for Melanie Martinez tickets. And I remember getting a lot of backlash for it maybe. I don't know if that's the right word, but I just kept going. That the backlash isn't even, I guess, the, I mean, obviously that is an important aspect, they're part of this. But the most important thing to note here is that I just lied. And the whole thing was fabricated. And I did that a lot. But majority of my content was, um, after that stories and some of them were true. But that's almost, I almost don't want to say that because it's kind of minimizing the fact that 95% of the shit that I would say was just a fucking lie. And it's wrong. I lied about the most egregious fucking batshit crazy insane things. I lied about having a sugar daddy. I lied about having multiple. I lied about doing drugs. By the way, I know that that almost sounds contradictory because I made these things. By the way, I'm still going to continue with the list. A huge aspect and part of my personality and my persona, at least that's my perception of it. And it's just wrong. And it's, like I said, contradictory to kind of continue that because I almost had like evidence. The thing that I'm thinking of is one time I made a vlog. And I had shrooms on the table. And those were dried mushrooms from the Asian store. And I'm so embarrassed and humiliated as I should be. That's genuinely the fucking bare minimum, honestly. But it was a lie. I had never actually done drugs. And I talked about doing them. I think even up until recently, online that would pertain to maybe the euphoria video I can't remember. But I mentioned Molly. And I don't know if I said that I had done it or at least alluded to, but I have not. The most I've done is smoke weed. And that's about it. I have seen, I guess, I don't, I don't, it's almost like, you know, you're probably asking like, why? Like, why the fuck would you lie about those things? And I almost want to be like, I don't fucking know. But the reality is just that I, I wanted to feel cool. And that shit is not fucking cool. I don't know why the fuck I do. That's not the point. I wanted to feel cool. I wanted to feel tougher. I wanted to feel more confident, more secure in myself. I lied and the reality is that I fucking fucking fabricated many different personas and personalities and 10, 15, 20, fucking 25 different people. I have been in my life. And I think the stories were a part of that. And it's wrong to promote the seatful behavior. And it's wrong to lie about those things because there are real life consequences from them. For one, the drug thing, what does that send out to people, especially the fucking young people, the teenagers fucking washing me and shit like that. I don't know what could have happened. I can only imagine and I don't want to catastrophize. But that's, you know, I sent out the wrong fucking message and I stuck, stuck by that for a long time. The sugar daddy thing, really downplaying the horrors of the sex and adult entertainment industry. I lied about stripping. I have auditions, but I didn't follow through with it. And I don't know why I, I do know why. There's no point in separating honestly myself from these things because I did that. I fucking did that. Not in a good way. Jesus. I know I did that has other, okay, move on. I lied about being diagnosed bipolar and that's wrong. I almost want to follow that up by immediately saying I have something else. But I don't want to say what it is, which might seem selfish. But I also want to protect that community and those people. I want to not associate these behaviors with them because you can have those problems and not be a shitty person. Jesus, sorry, sorry. But that's wrong. I had a lot of issues, a lot. I talked about them briefly. I had some tough shit going on. I did struggle with things that I don't want to talk about because I don't want to make it about that. But just know that it was wrong. Sorry, I really don't want to be that person. Jesus, that person that fucking, it's not about me. It is obviously. But it's not about how I feel it's about. I did this and it's wrong. It's wrong. It's wrong to lie. And I deleted, I believe, all of the videos pertaining to that kind of stuff a year or a year and a half ago. And I feel like that's not good enough. I feel like I don't want, like I said, pretending like shit didn't happen to be a part of who I am, let alone what I put out into the world. So I lied. And I lie. Hopefully this is the first step in being honest and being truthful. I really don't. I'm almost like looking for the right, there is no right words I think. Just know that it was wrong, which is so fucking repetitive. And I almost want to say that, I mean, obviously an apology means something. But to me, it doesn't mean shit without me changing and doing better. And I hope that this is a part of that. And I really am so sorry that I contributed to so much bullshit and made this a really unhealthy and toxic place for myself and potentially other people. Definitely other people. It was wrong. It was wrong to lie. And it was wrong to lie about such serious things. I lied about watching someone die. Jesus, I lied about being a whole, sorry, I had to think there for a second. I lied about so many things that have real life, real life, I mean outside of the internet and also on the internet obviously consequences and stigmas. I fucking contributed to that shit and it's wrong and it's fucking discussing. And I do not stand by that shit and I don't want to ever do that again. But it's also appropriate to talk about it because like I said, I don't want to keep on hiding and running. Now, that kind of leads me to the next portion that I want to talk about, which sorry, by the way, if that was also really long and kind of dragged it on. I know that it was a little repetitive. I am trying to really find the words. But that kind of brings me into my next point, which is the Black Sun. I transitioned my content like I said and like you can see if you watch me into social commentary and commentary in general. And I don't even know where to start. When it comes to this, all I want to say is that this kind of ties into the whole lying thing. As I mentioned, I fabricated a lot of personalities and personas and ran away from who I was and what I was feeling and my insecurities and inadequacy that I was feeling, et cetera, et cetera. And I think a part of that was definitely, you know, the the Black Sun to put it plainly. I exaggerated the way that I talked. I changed the way that I talked intentionally at times. There are times nowadays where it still slips out. And I feel this insane amount of pressure, which by the way, again, this isn't about me and feeling better. Sorry, I'm checking if it's still recording because the camera shuts off after about 20 minutes of trying to maintain this. And it's I ask myself why maintain that? Because I've always known that there's something wrong with doing that. And I've tried every goddamn excuse in the book. The computer, my laptop, by the way, is recording the audio. I'm not reading off of a script. I'll be I have practiced and kind of thought what I'm going to say. It's different when you're actually sitting in front of the shit because you don't actually know where this is going. But yes, let's let's fucking continue. I have exaggerated and changed the way that I talked. The way that I talk a lot of the time. And it became apparent to me during I don't want to I mean, I do want to of course explicitly say what it was a podcast that I created. But please only keep this to me because of their people parties involved are genuine. And that's really who they are. Me, I know that I was it was a combination of many things mirroring other people feeling insecure, which almost sounds like fucking bullshit that I'm about to say this. So maybe I shouldn't say this, but I just want to provide a little bit of context because I also want people to know that I know where this is coming from and I want to change it. I am not black. I have never of course said outright or alluded to being black. That I remember that I have the knowledge of please, please correct me if I have. I am Asian and white. My mom is Filipino. And I believe Chinese as well. I'm not entirely sure. I've never fully asked her, but I believe so. Yes. And my dad is finished. I'm half white and half Asian. I'm not black. And to talk in a way that maybe I didn't have black people and marginalized groups in mind. In me fabricating a new persona, but the consequence is still the same. I'm still adding to stigma that impacts them in worsens their lives. And it's wrong. It's fucking wrong. And I was wrong for that. And it slips up every now and then. There are times when I ask myself all the time, what the fuck do you even sound like? Right? And I really don't want to make this about me. So I'm about me in that way. So I'm not going to do. Sorry, I'm still checking if the camera is recording. As I said, it kind of cuts off. I don't want to. It's not even about how I feel. And oh, I felt guilty. I should. And I do. And I feel fucking horrible. And it's wrong. It's so fucking wrong. And I really want to stop. And I have seen people talk about this before in comments. I have received. It's going to cut off. Hold on. It cut off. Sorry. I have received messages on Instagram about this subject. And like I said, I've tried every excuse that mixed kid syndrome of I had a white voice and this and that. And it was just denial upon denial upon denial because the root cause of it is once again, the lying. So these two things kind of tie in together where I couldn't admit to myself that I was fabricating different personalities and personas. And I don't have all the answers. And again, I am sorry that it's just simply put it was wrong. It is wrong. Not was. It is wrong. And I don't want to do that shit anymore. I have a lot of questions for myself. I think there's a lot of confusion and shock. And not not only on my part, but maybe, you know, if you're watching too, I understand. If you feel betrayed or disgusted or you know, there are consequences. And this is just the right thing to do is to talk about it. I don't want to contribute to that shit anymore. And I want to do better. I don't care necessarily about being the best or being good, which is maybe what I was subconsciously or consciously both probably focused on for some time. But the truth is it doesn't even matter. I just want to be and do better. And this is a part of that is me admitting and talking about this candidly and openly how many times can I goddamn repeat myself? I lied and I fabricated and I contributed to a lot of harmful things in society. I contributed to a culture that breeds so much hate and disdain towards black people and other marginalized groups, namely people of color. And I evaded and I ran and I hid and that was wrong too. And I don't want to do that shit anymore. And I don't want to be that person. And goddamn, sorry. I just want to, like I said, do better. So now kind of ties into the transition, I guess I've been avoiding for a little bit of what now? What next? Well, like I said, I have removed those videos from the past, going back to point number one, I have removed those videos from the past. And I think the best thing for me to do involving that is to just really sit and reflect on my own time, get to the root cause of it, which I already know and have inklings of what that root cause is. I want to work on that and never do that shit again. And I want to acknowledge when I make mistakes. And this isn't even just, it was a choice. I chose to do this. I made the wrong choice over and over again. And I need to sit with that and absorb that. And I know it's selfish to ask for time. I know it's selfish to say that I need to take a break because I will acknowledge this is a dark gray. It's not entirely black and white where I contribute only bad or maybe I do. But I do want my videos to help people and make them laugh. And they bring me a lot of joy to make. So I will really want the actual content and who I am to reflect that rather than add to all of the fucking horror and disgust in this goddamn world. So I need to reflect and really think and soak it in and feel the shame and guilt and embarrassment. And here people tell me whatever they need to say. Everyone has the right to be mad and angry and disappointed and blame me or not blame me. I don't want. Oh my god. This sounds so emotionally manipulated where I'm like, oh my god, what was me? No, that's not what I'm trying to say. What I'm trying to say is that I will probably need some time to take in as well just everything and work on myself outside of online and this platform and my job essentially. Regarding the black set, I also will kind of do the same thing where I take times you reflect and think and I don't want to do that shit again and I don't want to run away from taking responsibility either and I want to hold myself accountable and I want to be that type of person that isn't a fucking piece of shit simply. And I know, first of all, I don't want to say like I'm a fucking piece of shit. I don't want to make a scene like that. That's not what I'm trying to do either but it's shitty to do that, to have a black set to contribute to racial stereotypes. First of all, it's already racist to say to associate black people with that particular dialect or way of talking or speaking. It's already wrong as it is and I've hid behind so many things. I've said I have a white voice and another voice which what does that even mean? I've said that I'm from Atlanta. I grew up in a small town a one hour away from Atlanta, an hour and a half away from Atlanta. I grew up middle class in a predominantly white neighborhood. I was just pretending and holding somewhat of a facade and it's probably a lot for some people to be like shit. Why weren't you just being yourself? And I just couldn't. I just couldn't for a long time. And maybe actually that's just who I was is vindictive and not smart doing the wrong things. This is not very, this is not meant to be I don't have the words. It just that's probably just who I was is somebody who couldn't admit the truth to themselves and subsequently other people. And now I want to focus on being better, having this space return or not returned but now become and transform into something else. I don't want to say that it's almost like that feeling of well god damn do I even deserve to come back? Because I've made such big mistakes over and over again but just know that I do want to and I want to make not only educational but also entertaining content based on the things that I give a shit about but part of me giving a shit is doing things that are actually going to contribute to not only a better world but being a better person. And that's what this is. That's what this is. So this is probably in so long I haven't felt fully like I'm being authentic to what the base level is. I think this is coming close to it. It will probably take adjustment. I do fuck up still. Not that I want to make fucking up a part of my god damn person or brand or whatever the fuck both. I don't, I don't. Sorry Jesus again. So I'm going to try and I'm so sorry if I haven't said it clear enough I'm so god damn sorry. And to me in apology means fucking nothing without me actually doing and being better. So I will work on that. Yes. Thank you for listening. Thank you if you got this far for listening for maybe not understanding but wanting to hear it out. Just thank you for everything so far. It's so messy and fucking convoluted. It seems to be my favorite god damn word but that's really what I can say is that it's just all over the place is that there's so many bits and pieces of me and then alternate me is scrapped in together that it's not just it's so great but me not acknowledging this shit would be really really dark gray and that's fucking wrong. It's fucking wrong. That's fucking wrong really fucking wrong Jesus I'm so yeah. I'm just thinking about god damn everything Jesus just Jesus that's that's it fucking Jesus again thank you and I'm sorry and I will do better for those of you who are asking when will you it's not even about that what the fuck I'm not going to talk about that but for anybody who wants to say don't stress about it too much you're not in the wrong do not downplay this shit maybe it's not entirely wrong but it because of the context or whatever but the consequences everything it's just wrong it's just wrong please do not excuse this shit you wouldn't do it for other people don't do it for me which sounds so fucking weird like what sorry I just had this perception of like why am I thinking so highly of myself people would excuse it anyways um this video is already long enough as it is uh thank you so much again I'm sorry so sorry again and I will take the time to be and do better and I hope I can come back and things will be different or maybe I won't I don't know I don't know I don't know all I know is that right now I need to change some shit I need to be better and do better so yes uh thank you for listening again and please have a great rest of the start of the week and think that's the time frame yeah uh it's Sunday June 26 as I'm creating this and please please just treat each other right do do what you feel is right question yourself and question other people too within reasonable uh level of trust and doubt of course and thank you again"
072_Try,"Ned Fulmer is no longer working with the Try Guys. By now we're assuming you've seen the Reddit threads and TikToks and tweets and news articles. We want to give you a timeline of what's transpired and some transparency into our decision making. Throughout this video there will be things that we want to say or go into further, but as I'm sure you're aware there are some legal issues we have to consider as we go through everything. On Liberty Weekend, multiple fans alerted us that they had seen Ned and an employee engaging in public romantic behavior. We reached out to check on that employee, Ned confirmed the reports, and since confirmed that this had been going on for some time, which was obviously very shocking to us, and we just want you to know that we had no idea this was going on. All of that information was just as shocking to us as all of this has been for you this week. And thus began a three week process of engaging with employment lawyers, corporate lawyers, HR, PR, and more. In order to make sure we were taking all necessary steps. From the jump, we were acutely aware of just how contrary this was the values of the company we've built and those of everyone who works here. This is something we took very seriously. We refused to sweep things under the rug. That is not who we are and is not what we stand for. We immediately removed Ned from work activities and engaged in HR professionals to conduct a thorough review of the facts. We also opted to remove Ned from our releases pending the results of that review. Over a few weeks, that's included removing his section from videos digitally removing him from others, and choosing not to feature him in our merch throws. Honestly, I want to give major props to our editing staff for how definitely they've handled that. There are several videos that we've deemed as fully unreleasable. You will never see them and that is due to his involvement. And that's a decision that has cost us lots of money. We will not be able to recruit that money, but it's a decision we stand by proudly. Now we can't talk about the details of the review, but suffice to say we found that Ned had engaged in contact... Well, conduct unbecoming of our team, and we knew that we could not move forward with him. So on Friday, September 16th, the three of us signed written consent of the members of Second Try LLC approving the removal of Ned as a manager and an employee. We chose not to rush into the announcement for a few reasons. Namely, there are real people who have been affected. And while we consider this a company matter, there's just also a family at the center of this. Now we were always planning on a public statement. And we're working towards that with our team, but in light of rapidly accelerating speculation we knew we couldn't wait any longer. We were obviously incredibly shocked and deeply hurt by all of this. This is someone who we'd built a brand and a company with for eight years. We feel saddened, not just personally, but on behalf of our staff and our fans who believed in us. I don't know that we'll ever be able to fully articulate the pain we feel at this moment. It's hard to rewatch old videos that we love and are proud of. We're losing a friend, we're losing someone, we built a company with, we have countless memories with. We just made a TV show together. I'm sure many of you feel the same way. It's weird. We're sorry that this ever happened, and we don't know what more to say. There's also our staff of 20 strong who they just don't deserve the negative attention our brand is now getting because they didn't do anything. But there are family and there's some of the most talented creative minds in the world. And our primary focus right now is making sure they feel comfortable and proud coming to work. The work they do never ceases to astound us. And frankly, there's just no world in which we could have navigated all of this without them. Now there are videos that were shot ahead of all this, right? We're going to be editing net out like the new season of without a recipe. And we're working with our editors and finding creative solutions to the footage. And we also have some branded videos that we've already committed to. So when you see a video that's sponsored in a few weeks and you're like, oh, that's kind of weird. Really, yeah, it is kind of weird. It's just how things are. That's why. Look, I get that one stuff like this happens. There's going to be speculation and gossip. And we ask that you respect the privacy of the family members and employees who may be caught up in this. We also want to remind you that the Internet has a tendency to be a lot harsher towards women than men. So please, we ask that you exercise kindness. Things will change here. What we hope is that within this, there's also the opportunity for positive growth. And better videos ahead. But it's going to be hard. It's this whole thing is going to be really fucking hard. And we imagine you have lots of questions, lot more questions right now. And we're going to have more to say in the future. Just right now, we're focused on bringing the best content possible between now and the end of the year. And then figuring out what the future of this channel looks like from there. That's it for now. Again, more to come. Some things may change. We are just sort of figuring it out all one day at a time. Thank you for your support. We appreciate you. And we look forward to introducing you to the next era of the TriGazahead."
073_Brack,"I'm sure you guys have a ton of questions, so I'm basically just making this video to explain myself and what was going on on my end so that you guys aren't so in the dark about this. I'm sure most of you guys know about the drama that's been surrounding me and my ex-girlfriend Sophie. Before I say anything else, I just want to say I am so, so sorry to Sophie. Sophie is literally the sweetest girl I've ever met and she did not deserve any of this. She has literally been nothing but perfect to me this entire relationship. When me and Sophie started dating about a year and a half ago, I had absolutely no idea it was going to be this long term. I met Sophie when I was 16 years old and she was a few years older than me and we were obviously in very different points in our life. When our relationship started to get a little bit more serious, that is when social media found out and you guys loved us as a couple, which was great, but also put a ton of pressure on the relationship. As time went on, I felt I was too young and too immature to be in a relationship this serious at such a young age. When this started to really freak me out, I tried to do what I should have done and I went to her house and I tried to end the relationship. However, I definitely could have done a better job on my part of explaining the whole situation to her because on her end it seemed very out of the blue while I was trying to break up with her and completely random because there's no way that she could have known how or why I felt this way because again we were in different points in our life. On top of that, Sophie was literally the perfect girlfriend so it was really hard to explain to her that I just wasn't ready to be this committed to somebody before I was even 18. Throughout that conversation, she ended up actually convincing me to stay and I hate myself every day for not just being a man and breaking it off when I knew I should have. But also in the back of my mind, I kind of knew without a concrete reason of why we were breaking up, I didn't know what the hell I was going to tell you guys because you know as our relationship went on the dofee fans were getting stronger and stronger and you guys loved us. After that conversation, we just continued to date, like none of that happened. But just because we didn't talk about it didn't mean I stopped feeling that way. Don't get me wrong, Sophie was literally my best friend so I loved hanging out with her and we made so many amazing memories that I'm never going to regret and I'm always going to remember but this was when you know being too immature and not ready started to affect our relationship negatively. I felt trapped in our relationship and I made some choices that I am always going to regret. There are absolutely no excuses for what I did. There are so many better ways that I could have approached the situation but again I was young and stupid and I should have just broken it off when I had the chance. I feel absolutely horrible because Sophie did not deserve this at all. She was nothing but perfect to me entire relationship. She was the sweetest girl ever. She did not deserve this. I did not deserve her and Sophie if you're watching this I am truly so so so sorry. After what happened I was kind of expecting Sophie just to cut me off and never talked to me again but she decided she wanted to give me a second chance. So I took it. But after a couple of weeks of trying to rekindle our relationship we realized that there's no way it was going to work and we ended up officially parting ways. The way things ended we're actually very mature and respectable. We had a couple long conversations about it and we both agreed that I need to grow up a bit and that I wasn't mature enough to be in this relationship and we left it off as still friends. I do not blame her for being upset at me or mad at all. I just felt the need to make this video because obviously in her video she didn't actually explain any of the information. Again I'm not trying to make any excuses for myself. I know that I'm completely in the wrong. I should have known I wasn't ready to be in a serious relationship and I should have broken it off when I had the chance. I was selfish and immature and it resulted in me hurting somebody that I care about a lot. To all the dovey fans out there I also want to say I'm so sorry I know you expected more of me. I'm still growing and maturing as a person and having tens of millions of eyes on your high school relationship at 17 was just not at all something I was ready for and as a result I hurt so many people and for that I am so sorry. I would also like to apologize to my friends, my family and amp. I wanted to be clear that I am fully responsible for my actions. Nobody else should be blamed for any of this. I'm going to stay up social media for a little bit and just kind of focus on myself because I feel like that's what I need to do. I would really appreciate if you guys could just give me some space and some privacy while I navigate through this part of my life. Again I'm so, so sorry to everybody that's affected and a huge sorry to Sophie. You deserve so much better than this."
074_Jayus,"Hi, I'm Bella. You might know me as only J.S. and three years ago, after losing my retail job, I decided to pursue social media seriously because I had a hundred thousand followers and I saw the potential of that growing. If you've been here for a while, you might know me from my Psychology trick series. Psychology trick is the fuck with somebody's mind that I know work because I use them. Or if you're newer, you might know me from my series of life hacks. I used to cube to get gum out of the hair. The people, one thing you can do is put a little bit of honey on it, cover it with the bandaid overnight. If you have to fake being sick over the phone and make sure that you hang your head over the bed. You might know me though, under more controversial circumstances. Past, I said disgusting things to people. Then fucking video about it! She wanted to fight me and I was like honestly thinking about it. This man who assaulted me last night. My joining us for dinner may be on for UAC. I've been going back and forth for a while on whether or not I should even make this video or just keep pushing forward, making my normal content. But I felt like this is something that's necessary in order to move forward. You know, in order for somebody to grow, they have to reflect. And I have been privately, but I also feel like this is something that I need to do in front of you guys. So today, I'm here to take full responsibility, accountability, and apologize for some of my past actions, as well as provide the full context around some of those actions. And by doing that, I'm not trying to excuse, justify, or even condone anything. This video is just to explain some of the situations that have been talked about, but not by me. You know, the full story that's been left off the internet, because this is the first time that I'm addressing anything in a way that I wish I would have in the first place. In 2016, I got into an argument over Instagram DMs with Andrew Kantskate about me unfollowing him. We were about teenagers and being dumb. This argument escalated to the point of personal insults and just saying really awful shit to each other. Andrew had been somebody that watched my YouTube channel, or my old YouTube channel, before I ever had TikTok. So he knew quite a bit about me because I talked a lot about family trauma, being in the foster care system. And so he was taking all of that and throwing it at me, and I didn't really know this guy, so I was just taking nonsense and throwing it back at him for the sake of arguing. But after this argument, I blocked him. So the entire chat on my end disappeared. So the only screenshots we have of this are the ones that he had, which is why there was no date given when this leaked, and why the entire side of his messages are gone. They're just not there. It literally looks like I'm going off on this guy for no reason, but there was a back and forth. So he got mad that I unfollowed him, and he was like, oh, whatever, I don't even care anyway. And I said, ex doubt, because he was messaging me about it. I figured he cared. And the argument should have just ended there, but unfortunately we go on. And I can see I'm making a lot of spelling errors because I was just typing out of anger so fast. And I can also tell that I'm just repeating insults off this list of insults that I found on the internet a few weeks prior. Come freak Bonerpill Middle-Leg, this baby arm lick my froth, f**k yo mama, eat fur pie, keyhole, cum, junkie plug, whole sucka, bag box, f**k toy, show the bags, sausage queen, meat drapes, get some squish, bust a f**k. I'm just getting way to into my personal life here. Like there doesn't need to be this much detail going on. And I'm saying all these awful things here. Like I just, I hope your parents get cancer because he was telling me like, oh, you deserve to be abandoned by your parents. You deserve to be in foster care. Your mom should have aborted you when she had the chance. And that obviously hurt me. And just rereading this, I feel really gross because I'm remembering how I felt then, which was really gross. It just, it wasn't a productive conversation. We were both just saying the most harmful things we could think of in the moment. But this is where I went way too far. Like it, I sent racist and homophobic messages. I shouldn't have said this. It doesn't make sense that I did. I don't understand why I did. I've been thinking about it for the past two years. Ever since this came out like, why on earth would I say that? I've been trying to rationalize it and I can't because there's no rationality here. I was calling him gay out of my own internalized homophobia. But the racist thing is just fucked up. There's no excuse for it. I deserve to be called out on it and all the backlash I got for using that kind of language. Andrew reached out to me four years later on December 7th, 2020 saying, yo, I was going through old VMs and found this. I would have sent all that if I were you. There were no messages between me and him. So I sent him a screenshot of that and said, yeah, there's nothing there. So he sent me what I had said and reminded me of this person that I used to be. This hateful, angry, toxic person. So I apologized. I sent him a voice memo apologizing and he said, no, you're good. I just know we both have platforms now and everybody's getting canceled nowadays. And I still felt bad. So I apologized again like over text. And he said, yeah, keep killing it. That's kind of where I thought it ended, you know, like I tried to forget about it. Not forget about it. But like put it in the back of my head because this didn't align with the person I was trying to be, you know, like I apologize to this person that I insulted. He forgave me. I thought that was it. Those screenshots were leaked two months later in February of 2021, right after I had hit 10 million followers on TikTok. And I remember I woke up and checked my Instagram and just saw tons of people messaging me about it. And I responded to one person and I told them that the screenshots were photoshopped. They're not. I did say all of that. But what I meant by that was was they were edited in the sense that his entire side of the conversation was gone. But that doesn't really matter because I did say all of those things. And the news of this was blowing up. TikTok's most progressive and pro LGBTQ creators. Only J.S. is right now being called out for saying the N-word in a D-A-S. People are super upset with only J.S. I heard only J.S. was getting canceled. I haven't heard it by now. Only J.S. has been exposed. But being not only a racist, but a homophobic will. I knew I needed to apologize and I wanted to write away. So I reached out to somebody who was my manager at the time being like, hey, this is happening. I'm going to say something. But they told me not to do anything. They said, let's wait to see if this gets bigger first. And I was like, no, I'm guilty right now. But they were more worried about my brand deals. Well, I was upset about hurting people because I knew I was letting more and more people down by the second. I had friends from high school in college reaching out to me being like, Bella, what's going on? Is this true? And then I had to admit to that. And some people just cut me off immediately. So I knew if I was losing these relationships that I had with people for years at this point that there were people in my audience watching this feeling just as betrayed. So even though it was advised against me saying, oh, and so blow over, I started writing my apology. They asked for one anyway, like a day later after seeing how viral this was going. So I sent them what I wrote. And it was kind of like this, a full YouTube video addressing and apologizing for everything I said. And they said, no, this is way too long. And it needs to be on TikTok. So I rewrote it to shorten it, sent it to some friends and asked for their advice on it, sent it back to viral nation who made me rewrite it, rewrite it again until three days later, they finally gave me the okay to record and post. This is where the whole ghost writer narrative comes from. But I want to be very clear when I say that I wrote my apology. I'll admit I was in this privileged position to get help from people and how to go about it. But that's only because I didn't want to mess it up. I don't think there's anything wrong with asking somebody to proofread something before sending it off to millions to listen to. But my apology and my words are my own. Hindsight, I understand that I shouldn't have just followed the direction I was being given by this management and I should have trusted myself from the beginning and because I didn't and instead made a two-part TikTok apology full of emotion. The whole thing came off really weird. And that's a choice that I made, a choice that I regret but I've kind of come to terms with that. I just, I think the reason why I was listening to all the feedback I was getting was because I didn't feel like I was in a place to trust myself. If you've been watching me for a while, you know that I've struggled with insomnia for years and this situation didn't help that. I was up all night reading the comments, reading all the DMs, watching every single video that anybody had ever made about me. So by the time that I actually went to make this apology video, I had an slap in five days. In my past, I said disgusting things to people and I am so ashamed of myself for using racist rhetoric and derogatory language to hurt others. Because I knew what that word meant and I understood the power behind me. I did. I was 17. When I said these things, that's plenty old enough to know better. But I said it anyway because it was the meanest thing that I could think of. Meanest thing I could think of probably wasn't the best way to say this. I think what I meant was that it was the most toxic thing I could possibly say. And I am so sorry to everyone but especially to those in the Black community because only you guys can forgive me for this. I didn't say that because I expected the Black community to forgive me. I said it because I literally just met that they were the only ones who could forgive me. Because at this point, I was getting a lot of comments being like, it's okay, J.S., I forgive you. Even though I hadn't apologized yet and you click on their profile and it's just a white kid. And it's like, no, you can't forgive me because it wasn't targeted towards you. And there is no excuse and there are no justifications for what I said and you guys deserve better. And when I first saw the screenshots, I didn't even think that they were real because I forgot how hateful and how angry of a person I used to be. And it hurts my soul knowing that I said those things. But the screenshots and the things I said in my past are not a reflection of who I am today. And I'm so grateful for the people in my life that I met after high school in college at my previous jobs and I took their time to educate me on their experience. That's another thing. I don't bring up my age in this because I didn't want it to be like, oh, I was so young, it's in the past. Please forgive me. But I'm bringing it up now because of how much time has passed. It wasn't time wasted, you know? Like, I graduated high school from a racist Trump supporting town. Left, went to college and played basketball with this amazing group of girls who really opened up my eyes because I started seeing how professors were treating them versus treating me. You're like, hotel staff will go on like travel games. And then I got a job and my co-workers gave me this whole different world view just hearing like about how police would treat them versus like the one time that I got a speeding ticket and then I would see how like customers would treat them versus treating me like somebody with white privilege and kind of cliche. But I did a lot of psychedelics and I had an ego death and I realized that the reason that I hate my life and I hate myself was because I wasn't a good person. So then I went to therapy and started to unpack like all this childhood trauma and realizing how it was affecting me in my behaviors. And then I got a tick-tock and grew this platform to millions of followers within the span of like a month and then the pandemic happened and then the Black Lives Matter movement really picked up and I truly saw myself as an ally so I was posting about like police brutality and had a better-the-fossor system, gave rights, feminism and then all this came out and the world was exposed to this part of myself that I so desperately want to punch in the face. This is because listening to them was so powerful and a real reality check for me. So I want to take this time to take a step back and share my platform with some amazing Black creators who are going to tell their story to try and educate others on the trauma that happens when we use this kind of language. I know that my words hurt people and I know that my words have consequences and that there is no immediate fix for my actions but I am so deeply sorry for all the pain that I caused. I did take a step back, okay? I didn't post for about two weeks and before I posted this apology I did have a good group of creators who agreed to make videos that I would post on my page and that I would tag them but then I posted the apology and the reaction was just so overwhelmingly negative that none of them wanted to be associated with me. That just meant that I had to restart and I had to reach out to a whole new group of creators that I didn't really know and that took a lot of time. I worked with Dr. Koujo posted a TikTok and made a whole podcast with him which was really cool because he's really influential in the mental health space. I also posted a video on TikTok calling out TikTok for unfairly deleting the accounts of a bunch of Black creators like Kiyota Rose and Nathan Locus. I also posted multiple videos with Black man Black Fodding that he posted, I just put on my page and tag them for it and the only reason I ever stopped working with him was because he started asking me for money and then asking me to ask you guys for money and it just kind of felt weird but I was also duetting a bunch of other creators that had good messages like Poppy J, Black Gloves and Untouchable Blane and even with all that the majority of people were saying that I wasn't working with Black creators because these videos weren't reaching the majority of TikTok and I was also around this time being called out for not working with certain creators and the reason that certain collaborations didn't happen was because I was doing most of my reaching out through Instagram and TikTok but some people reaching out to me via email the email that I had in my bio but it wasn't an email that I had access to my emails were Gmail that email was something my management had I didn't have access to it and because I wasn't making my management money anymore they were slowly dropping me and not really going through my email and forwarding things that I should have seen there just there wasn't a whole lot of communication going on at a time when communication was at like most crucial and I've sent apologies and I've reached out to people who were affected by this and even if they weren't met with forgiveness that's understandable but I did try to show that I was growing in other ways failed ways admittedly like the time that I posted about a book that I had read called How to Be Anti-Raisist not How to Not Be racist just How to Be Anti-Raisist like How to Be a Better ally I should have just read the book and kept it to myself but there were a lot of comments asking me how have you changed and I felt the need to prove myself and that was a mistake I should have just kept it in private because it was all coming off really performative I regretted a lot I just I know that the promise that I made didn't go as planned instead of having Black creators film my page while I wasn't there I was posting normally and it was like more spread out so I know that people were expecting me to do one thing and I didn't do it that way only because things weren't going as expected I could have handled everything better and I'm really sorry for other missteps that I took I said it from the start that I know my actions have consequences and those consequences were some of the hardest things I've ever had a deal with in my life I've talked about this before but like after all this my address got leaked and people were actually like showing up so I had to find a new place to live moved to that new place and my sleep and my mental health was just not great so I started therapy again and with that I got diagnosed with ADHD and I never ever brought up ADHD to try and use it as an excuse for everything it was more so it was this new thing for me it was really clicking like ADHD rejection sensitivity and just like the memory issues it was all making sense but more so than that my medication I started medication and then my medication changed and so like that was affecting everything how I thought how I didn't like my day it was it was a lot and I'm only really saying this okay because it took me a while to grasp that being called out and being hated it forced me to like look at how I needed a change it was necessary to put me on the path of who I became today so after all this I tried to resume just making my normal content I was known for fun facts and sometimes I would do like fake fun facts put it in the caption be like ha ha got you and people really seem to like this and so when I started getting known for life hacks I started doing illegal life hacks and looking back I should have never started this series because the accusations of me being an ableist came from this service dog ever approaches you but they're alone that means that their owners in trouble and they probably can't move so you should follow him because you'll get a free wallet yes that's a fucked up thing to say but every single one of these videos has been titled illegal or immoral meaning don't actually do this because it's fucked up and I felt that people who watched my content understood that I wasn't advocating for you to rob people who are disabled if you ever see a dog in a service vest and he's alone you should follow it because there's probably some way that needs your help and by me saying you'll get a free wallet I was just quoting this year's old internet meme that I'd seen that I'm funny multiple times and I understand now that because I'm not somebody who is disabled it wasn't my joke to make and with how large my platform is there are people that saw that and were hurt by it I didn't mean to cost fear in anybody and I apologize to those that I did have that impact on I should not have punched down like that another illegal life hacks video if you have an annoying relative that's asking you or you and your partner when you're going to have kids just tell them you're pregnant and then a few months later tell me how to miscarriage they're going to be so uncomfortable ever bringing it up again that you'll have your peace this is around the time that abortion rights went from being federally protected to being given to the states to vote upon and many states just outright banned it so a lot of people were afraid that a miscarriage could be considered illegal and I made this video to call out those who don't let others make their own choices because I know a lot of people who have family members that try to pressure them into having babies and that's what this video is trying to point out I understand though that I shouldn't have done it in this way because I've never had a miscarriage I have watched my mom go through several so I'm not completely ignorant to this situation but I am sorry for making this video because it was triggering I think I need to be more aware of the impact of my words rather than trying to understand my own intent you know just because I didn't mean any harm doesn't mean I didn't cause any so there are two reasons why people say that I am transphobic the first is from another illegal life hacks video you're dude label your gender as non-binary or female on your car insurance it will go down a lot there were a lot of videos going around saying that it's wrong for me to encourage cis men to lie about their gender to save money and I'll just point out again that I'm not actually encouraging anybody to do what I say in these videos because it is illegal and there will be consequences I just put it in this video to try and point out that men pay more on car insurance automatically and the other reason people say I'm transphobic is because I commented on a video of a person talking about gaydar but the trans version of it this video doesn't exist anymore but when you opened up the comment section it was full of people just laughing at this phrase that they used okay I lied to they were trying to be funny I'd never heard it being referred to as this before so I did what everybody else was doing and I commented the phrase and a dead emoji and next thing I know everybody's calling me a transphobic because I had just used a slur I didn't know it was a slur so I immediately reached out to this person the post of the video because they were a mutual of my and I was like, dude I'm so sorry I didn't know that I didn't know and they were like, it's okay like you're non-binary and I was like, yeah I am you know because I had been using they then all pronouns for a while at this point and they were like, nobody should be upset with you for this they told me to address it and I didn't really want to because I had a lot of family following me and I didn't feel comfortable addressing myself in that way outside of just pronouns in my bio and they understood that they forgave me and I kind of just left it at that but people still to this day call me transphobic over this even though I'm not cis it's kind of like calling me homophobic when I'm gay it doesn't really work so all of this sparked a petition asking TikTok to ban me they said I mistreated creators who are disabled and creators of color they also said that I failed to share my platform with black creators and that I hosted rigged giveaways which isn't sure at all I always post proof people received enterprises one who likes this comment $100 seemed simple right but it quickly got out of hand because it already had 26.2 thousand likes which would equal a bunch of fucking money that I don't actually have sorry I'm not Mr. Beast or David Dobrik yet but I wanted to be a team player so I decided to still give some money away so I picked a 10 of my Instagram followers and told them hey I want to give you money they all thought I was hacked but I did eventually convince them that it was actually me and then I sent them all $100 each on various money spending apps two of the winners by the way didn't even want the money they just asked me to donate it instead so I did and that was really sweet of them they said I hired a ghost writer which again isn't true I don't know who would want to claim my apology of the realm given how poorly it was received they also said I took my apology down which no I never took it down if you scroll back to February 2021 it is still there taking it down with the feet the purpose of apologizing this has over 400,000 signatures it's on track to be changed.org is like one of their top petitions partly because I signed it myself and then promoted it which is a really bad idea I thought that if I made fun of it it would make it better I was wrong I should have just addressed it for real at the time and I didn't. These are just a few of the lies that people have made up about me all the part of the J.S. slander and I've ignored most of it for a really long time but I'm calling this address everything so I'm addressing everything here are the most notable false allegations that people have made against me that I would like to clear up for obvious reasons I am not a Trump supporter I thought the screenshots from 2016 would make that pretty clear after it came out that I said the n-word a lot of people started saying that I took Black Lives Matter out of my bio I was posting in support of Black Lives Matter but it was never in my bio to take out of my bio so I don't know why this one got started and recently there's been a lot of videos popping up saying that I said the n-word again multiple times four times I say it all the time I'm just this openly raging racist I typed it out in a text the one text that I got held accountable for and that's it this word is not a part of my vocabulary I'm sure there's a lot of you watching this right now that I've kept up with all the controversy whether with the sunny be two video any of the other videos are just scrolling through comment sections but I'm pretty sure there's a lot of you that watch me that didn't know about any of this and it's coming as a huge shock like jesus controversial I know a lot of creators that would have just ignored this until it went away but I want to be somebody that's honest with those that support me and ignoring things isn't being the most honest I don't want to be a problematic person I enjoy creating content and researching and learning things and then sharing what I learned with you guys and you guys seem to enjoy it too and I just want to keep doing that making videos is something that I started on my family's home video camera and the fact that we turned it into this platform with 20 million people I can't even fathom or wrap my head around that many people but I'm making a promise to every single one of you and the promise is real because I've already made it to myself that I have and will continue to learn from my mistakes and work to be better it's this part of life that everybody has to go through but I put myself in this position where my mistakes and learning for my mistakes are public and I think I'm okay with being a learning lesson here maybe even a symbol of just because you're an asshole doesn't mean you'll always be an asshole nobody has to forgive you for the ass-holy things that you've done but if you want to change you can and if you're still with me here and you have any questions or thoughts on anything I've said I'll be responding down in the comments section below thank you guys for watching I appreciate it it really does mean a lot"
075_Ruxin," Today I'm making a video that no YouTuber really wants to have to make and I was hoping that I never would have to make, but in this video I'm going to be talking about a few things that I have messed up. I've messed up big times, so I wanted to make a quick video so that you guys know that what I'm thinking about this. I'm sure you guys have seen a couple of things, but I can't be too specific on the specifics here because there are some contract stuff, but you guys don't know what I'm talking about. First of all, it came to my attention yesterday, I believe I just got back in town from Thanksgiving and all that stuff, but it came to my attention yesterday that I've been promoting something that has come out to be most likely a scam. That thing I can't do my name, but you guys know what I'm talking about. We don't really do a lot of ads, and you guys have seen this specific one a lot. It came out of video basically saying that this specific thing is saying they will do certain things for you and you'll get to do certain things if you buy their thing. May or may not even be true that they're doing that, and then they're also doing things for the environment, they're like replanting trees, if you know what I'm talking about, and that may or may not even be happening. When I first accepted the sponsorship, I saw, okay, this is a fun gag gift. It's funny and all that stuff. Then they're also helping replant trees and all that stuff. I think this is a cool thing to do. I'd also seen IRL friends buy this before. I was like, okay, that seems legit because my friends are buying it and stuff like that. Also, other large YouTubers big time were promoting it. This has to be right. It has to be fine. First of all, that thought process was the issue. That was the mistake. I thought, okay, it's good because other people are doing it. Other people have bought it. It seems like they're doing something right. That was not enough research. That is the main theme here. I should have done more research for this before I promoted it to you guys because as a YouTuber, I have an audience that watches me. I want to actually, I need to be promoting things that I know for a factor good because I can cause people to buy something that is in fact a scam, which is what happened here. That is something that came to my attention yesterday. We're going to be talking about a couple of things. There was that. Yesterday, also, we had a video that I posted about a different TCG. Obviously, if you guys saw the video, it was not well received at all. Another thing that I should have done more research on. If I had done more research on this specific video on what I was opening, that I would have known that when I posted this video, it was not going to go well. Obviously, I didn't do that. I didn't do that well enough because I had an inkling, slight inkling of the disappointment and the product that we opened. I didn't realize how bad it was. Me opening it was not just a cool video for people to watch. Me enjoying some older stuff. It wasn't that. It was not that for most people that watch it. Some people, most people, I would say, that watched it were very upset with this because it means something more than just a fun opening like we normally do on the channel. It means the certain thing is taking advantage of people and stuff like that. Because I didn't do enough research, I made that video. I thought it would be fun, all this stuff, and it obviously didn't go so well. Because of contract stuff and stuff like that, I'm not going to name any names, but you guys know exactly what I'm talking about. Because of these two things that happened on the same day, we normally, we don't do a lot of sponsors, but we have in the last month, and they really have not gone that well. Both times, it's because I did not do my share of the research. For that, first of all, I want to take responsibility because this is my fault. It's my channel. I decide what goes on to it, and I decided wrong on both of these things. I want to apologize first of all for that because I don't want this to be a thing that continues in the future. It just happened yesterday, so I wanted to get it out immediately that I know I messed up. I know I messed up big time, not only on one certain thing, but both of these things. I know I messed up big time. I shouldn't have done either of these things. What am I going to do? I have not actually been compensated for any of this, so I'm just going to cut ties with both of the companies that I was working with. I'm just going to say, I think we're done here. I don't want to continue doing anything. I don't need to be compensated because if I am going to be compensated, that means I have to leave the videos up. I'm going to private the main video, the one that firm yesterday, and I'm going to cut out. I've already cut out everything for the other brand. I've cut everything out. I took the pin comments and all that stuff. All that stuff is gone, so I'm going to be taking all that stuff out so that no one else sees it anymore. Basically, I'm just going to cut ties with these and hopefully get a fresh start. For future sponsorships, which as a YouTuber, sponsorships are really important to stay like a float and have enough money for what we do on this channel, which is buy a lot of product and stuff like that. They are really important, so for future sponsorships, I'm not going to say I'm never taking sponsorships again, but I'm going to be doing a lot more research. I'm going to be vetting them, making sure they are actually legit. Not just assuming because someone else did it, it's probably fine. I'm going to be looking into it a lot more, making sure that I'm promoting stuff that is actually appropriate for you guys to see. I feel really bad about it, honestly. I really do. I wanted to make a video because I know that I could just have let it go. I could have just kept going, but I really don't want you guys to doubt me or doubt that a question, anything that I'm talking about, like, is he really mean it because he did this that one time? I want to cut this off as soon as possible. I want to end in my relationship with these other things, even the one that I thought would be a great thing, but really, I did not look into it enough. I think that I'm going to be doing that. This is no editing in this video, obviously, because I'm just kind of rambling. I just wanted you guys to get a legit look into what's been going on, what I'm going to do about this. Hopefully this will make things a little better because I definitely messed up. I know that I did, and that's why I wanted to come on here and take responsibility because I think it is important when you realize you've done something wrong because as soon as I posted that video yesterday, I knew I messed up. I was not in town, so I couldn't make a video. I just decided, look, it's time to take responsibility. I messed up, guys. Sorry about that. We're going to cut off everything that we can. I don't exactly know how that's going to go because contracts, I've never actually done this before. Normally, you just do it and there's no big deal, but this is a completely different scenario. I'm going to see what I can do about that. Thank you guys. I really appreciate it for just sticking with me and stuff like that because I know, I disappointed some people yesterday, and I did not, that was not my intention, but I did end up doing that. Once again, I'm trying to take responsibility here and I'm sorry about that for everything that's happened in the last couple of days. The last month that I didn't realize, but I probably should have if I did my due diligence and stuff like that. Thank you guys. That's pretty much it. Extra video today. We're still going to have normal videos coming tomorrow and stuff like that. I wanted you guys to know that if you guys did get duped into the one that was what we've been promoting a lot, just let me know. Then I can personally refund you because I don't want you guys to have lost any money on anything like that. That's it for this one. Thank you guys. Appreciate you guys understanding and watching. Peace."
076_Liver,"Primals, I'm making this video to apologize because I fucked up because I'm embarrassing ashamed because I lied and I misled a lot of people. I've stated that this is a complicated as fuck topic at least to me it is because before social media I was rich and anonymous and after social media I'm still rich but no longer anonymous and I never expected this kind of exposure in the public eye. It's been trickiest fuck to navigate. Well clearly I did it wrong and I'm here now to set the record straight. Yes I've done steroids and yes I'm on steroids monitored and managed by trained hormone clinician. Leverking the public figure was an experiment to spread the message to bring awareness to the four thousand people a day who killed themselves. The eighty thousand people a day that try to kill themselves are people are hurting at record rates with depression autoimmune anxiety infertility low ambition in life are young men are hurting them both feeling lost weak and submissive so I made it my job to model teach and preach a simple elegant solution called ancestral living then nine ancestral tenants so our people no longer have to suffer so we can collectively express our highest and most darned form this is my fight this is why I exist while spreading the message I've been on several podcasts and when asked if I've ever taken steroids I've always said no I don't touch the stuff not gonna touch the stuff never touch the stuff that was a lie I've convinced myself that this had nothing to do with the ancestral message I convinced myself that I'm not a competitive athlete of any kind so who the fuck am I cheating I convinced myself that this topic was a placeholder for a far more important conversation I convinced myself that this would overshadow that thirty six years of working out usually twice a day without PEDs I've convinced myself that this was a bulk of minority usually in the fitness category driving to an unproductive conversation and I had convinced myself that this would be the wrong message to send to the 15 year old boys so I continually dismissed it and I dug myself into a bigger and deeper hall I have only myself to blame I did that and it was all wrong I will be better I will talk about it openly because I believe that there's a time in a place for pharmacological intervention monitored and managed by a trained hornel physician in 2021 when I was 43 years old I didn't feel 100% physically or cognitively so I went to get monitored and managed by a trained hornel clinician see what the fuck was going on with my life and so yes it's true I have tried several peptide combinations and an effort to increase my growth hormone and it didn't work meaning that my levels still remained below the normal level so yes it's also true that I've tried pharmaceutical grade growth hormone and I've finally found success in managing therapeutic levels in the normal range yes this is true I've continued on with point six CCs of testosterone per week roughly 120 milligrams of testosterone a week and no I don't take any other steroids like nandralone or winstral but I have tried them in the past without success yes it's also true that my blood chemistry got all fucked up while taking nandralone and winstral my lipids got all deranged my liver enzymes went sky high which is why clinical oversight is an absolute must nope the liver king brand has had nothing or at least very little to do with my business success my companies were already kicking ass already successful before the liver king public figure growing at 50% year over year and still growing at the same pace after the liver king public figure nope I've never had ab implants ab etching or any other plastic surgery and I sure as fuck never actually had gene editing done and cement port I made all of that up it was all intended to be a joke and that's an expression of ancestral tinnitus have little goddamn fun ultimately why did I or why do I do them when I talk about the 85% of the population that suffers from self esteem issues that's me on part of that statistic this is why fucking work myself to death in the gym this is why I do 12 to 15 blood burning workouts a week just to feel like I'm okay still I have to absolutely crush myself to do so and I'm right physically and cognitively and hormone replacement has helped in a profound and significant way and still I believe that the path to paradise is paved and fucking hell I previously have said in a weird way I'm grateful for the recent events that have shed light on this complicated this fuck topic I knew I needed to take this opportunity to openly discuss everything for me to be a better human if there are any questions that remain unanswered send them my way I fully own that I fucked up I am sorry as a man can be and all I can do is take extreme ownership right now be better and lead myself to a better life as a better human again thank you to everyone for the support the criticism the love the hate and above all else the loyalty never key"
077_Nadia,"In today's video, I want to address something that happened to me this morning. I woke up this morning and I got a knock for my roommate, Dante. Tell me that I was banned on Twitch. I was very confused. I really didn't understand what happened. I mean, I just woke up and to be honest, I thought he was like pranking me for a second and which in my phone, the bunch of messages saying that I was banned. I was terrified. Like, I can't imagine what I do in two weeks of not streaming. I love streaming. I don't even like take days off because how much I love it. I look forward to this every day. So when I saw that, I genuinely was scared and it was probably one of the most terrifying moments of my life. But I got banned on Twitch for 14 days and here's the reason. I got banned for sharing personal information about somebody. So I kept getting a donation that popped up my stream labels and it was a person that was sending me hate and the name was anonymous and they did it four times. I was confused because one, I'm just like, okay, the first time, you know, I do get paid on donations sometimes because you know, they think it's funny to just have it pop up on the screen and I usually do get that. It is not new, but I haven't had somebody do it four times in a row. When I saw that, I was honestly really irritated and in a moment of weakness, I said, when you get a donation on your phone, the name of the person pops up. So I said the person's first and last name. And I just want to point out that all I did was say his first and last name. I know that there's rumors going around that I leaked the address of the person, but I didn't. I only said their first and last name. But looking back at it and having the time to reflect, I realized that wasn't the best way to combat the hate. And I should have played into it how I normally play into like hate comments and stuff, how I troll them back, but I didn't. And like I said, in a moment of weakness, I kind of just said what was on my mind and I realized now that I shouldn't have done that. This year has been one of the craziest years of my life and there's a lot of stuff that happened to me, you know, with streaming. I blew up. My life has changed completely. And with that came a lot of good things, but then also, you know, the hate that came along with it. And I mean, like if you go look at my TikTok comments right now, they're mostly hate. And I do plan to it. I'm not trying to play the victim card. What I'm saying is though, is I'm still trying to learn from it. I made a mistake and I do apologize to Twitch, and I appreciate them for unburning me, by the way. Thank you very much. And I want to continue this. And I know when continuing this, I'm going to continue getting more hate. So I need to learn how to deal with this and I'm going to. And I appreciate everyone that still supports me and understands that I'm human. I don't know where I'd be without you guys. Like I said, I really appreciate everyone who supports me. And I'm sorry if I let you guys down today. I promise I won't do that again. And I'm still learning. Thank you. Also, you guys next video. Bye."
078_Adin,"What up guys? By the televideos video I'm gonna get straight into it. I love everyone down bro. I'm honestly gonna take a full accountability for it and I'm not gonna lie and cover stuff up and I'm gonna let y'all know when I slip and I fail and I basically let temptation take over. Last night guys I went out and I drank. I've been on this journey where I haven't been having anything poison and toxic and I've been in the gym and built my mind and everything around my life accordingly. I just feel horrible because I know what I was doing was strictly temptation bro. Alcohol is literally straight from the devil bro. We are not in a conscious space. You're not supposed to, you can't even drive normally when you have alcohol. You're not supposed to be drinking alcohol. Human beings are not supposed to be taking an alcohol and honestly bro I'm not the type to, like I told you guys, cover it up and basically like say oh that wasn't me I didn't do that. No, I really messed up last night. I did it so I'm letting y'all know right now. I'm sorry for everyone that I let down and now I can really really understand how serious that is. You guys know I've been sobriety of everything. As of 2020, 2023 I've been no sex, no masturbation, you know just clean raw diets working out every day. I'm still going to the gym today. I haven't missed anything at the gym. My body's been looking like I said I had a nice little transformation. I'm really happy. I saw some results. You guys actually showed it to me. I'll pull up a little picture here you guys can see. Walk up with a raging headache and just horrible thoughts and literally just gloomy and sadness bro. I was just so sad and I was texting people that I wouldn't have texted when I would, I was basically texting girls and I shouldn't be texting girls because I was texting them because I was horny because I'm so celibate. I'm over 20 days celibate now. So ultra horny. You know this is like where like it's getting super duper hard. That's ironic right? But no for real though like I you know think I didn't, I didn't you know nut but you know it's just crazy. The temptation is really trying to take over but I promise you guys I'm going to be better and I'm going to make sure I give myself full cleanse. I'm going to go to the gym sitting that song for at least 20 minutes today and just sweat everything out and just you know still still be on my garage. Still be on my shin and I hope you guys can forgive me and see that I that this will happen again. I love you guys. I'm a state true to myself. I'm always going to stay true to you guys and yeah I'm going to be honest. I'm going to be honest. I'm going to be"
079_Pearl,"What up guys, welcome to the Jess Perlythings YouTube channel and welcome to Morning Coffee Thoughts where I give my thoughts over morning coffee. Today I have a chat, I quit coffee. You guys don't care about what I'm drinking. Okay. Today I'm going to be addressing the Nick Fuentes situation. Yeah, I know why you guys are here. Okay. So, I want to first say I take full accountability for everything that happened. Everything that happens in life as I say to the girls on my show is my own fault. The fact that people are making these videos is my own fault. And the situation that I'm in is my own fault. Now I'm going to give you guys an explanation and give you guys contacts for some of the conversations that we're had. Just know it's not an excuse, it's my own fault. I take full accountability for everything that happened. Okay. So, but I'm going to answer questions that people have brought my way. So the first thing is why did you have Nick on? So the reasoning behind having Nick Fuentes on was because I heard that he was on the no fly list and he lost his bank account. Now, from your point of view, you would think why would you invite someone on that's on the no fly list, right? That would be a bad, well he's not anymore. That's how he flew, but he was. So I was more just curious why this man was banned and everything. Now, I've seen a lot of videos that say I played dumb or I'm playing dumb and I'll tell you what I knew and what I didn't know. So I did know that he was known a known racist. I did know he was a known sexist. I did know that basically every bad name in the book from the right and the left everyone hated him. So the reason I had him on was because guys, people say that stuff about me. They say I'm sexist. They say I'm a misogynist. And I really just like to give people the benefit of the doubt when I interview them. I don't go into interviews trying to interrogate someone. I just more try to listen and see where they're coming from. In hindsight, that wasn't smart. In hindsight, I should have had someone maybe Sarah Garvey, maybe another content creator that could have pushed back more and really was more educated on the topics that he was talking about than I was because I certainly was not an expert in any of the stuff that he was talking about. I did remove the interview. I again did not think through a lot of the repercussions of posting that so I just removed it. But if you do want to see the full interview of City and did react to it, that's on his channel. The intention was not, I guess, to hide it. It was just, you know, this might not have been the best move. I'm just going to remove it now. So again, racism has no place in society. And I do take accountability for bringing him on. Hindsight's always 2020. I wrote down some of the complaints that people had. I looked this way. It's just because I made bullet points of everyone's concerns and I'm just addressing them. Okay. My Africans, that part. So in the heat of the conversation, I made some remarks to my producer, Blessing. Now, blessing is a godsend. Okay, blessing has made the production quality literally phenomenal. He's so talented. And during this conversation, we were talking about immigration. And I said, I'm trying to get my Africans to America. Now, I watched it back. I said, it was so cringy. Oh my gosh, she was so embarrassing. I met my African employees. I just said Africans. The reason, the reason is because, like, why wouldn't you just say my employees or whatever to America? The African passport system is just more difficult than the UK one. I didn't know. Like, Blessing had to go to the embassy or something to apply to go to America with me next month. We're going to go do some work there. And yeah. And so I've just found that the immigration process is a bit more difficult. So that's why I referred to them because my African employees, I needed more help with. And, you know, I was saying in the interview that I wanted more open border policies because I wanted them to come again. You know, I really respect the African culture. I had no ill will or malice towards any of that. But it sounded absolutely awful. It was so cringy watching back. You know, it was stupid. It was stupid. Okay. Now let's talk about my Africans was the other one. And then, oh, oh, the joke about blessing being late. So one thing that they cut out from that clip was that Nick Fuentes did say after, oh, I'm just giving you a hard time. I'm just kidding. Okay. Now, even so, it was still in poor taste. And what I didn't think about at the time was, sorry, for those that didn't see it. Basically Nick Fuentes was talking about he's always late. And I said, you're on time today. Oh, blessing was the one that's late. And it's sort of an inside joke here at Just Perly Things. And blessing is just, he's phenomenal. But he's just a late, he's a late guy. And every time he comes in, he says African time. Now Pearl, Pearl, me. So when I was referring, when I was referring to him during this joke, I was like African. Now I was saying African time, referring to what he says when he comes in. Now what I realized is this was especially disrespectful because we did have someone that's a known white supremacist race like, you know, making that joke in front of him with him is just import taste. And I did apologize to him for it. I really had no malice or ill will. But you know, stupid, it was just stupid. Okay. The next thing is I've gotten a lot of criticism for, you know, using the black culture and then I'm going right and leaving it like that sort of thing. You can correct me in the comments if I'm wrong, but that seems to be a big point of contention. My intention was never to be, you know, a quote unquote leader in the black manosphere or the manosphere in general. I really have always just looked at the men as the leader. I mean, they're the thought leaders. Let's just be honest. And me, I, you know, I try to support them in any way I can. You know, I bring them on my show. But saying I'm a leader in the space, you know, I feel like women follow men lead. So I really think, yeah, that's just, that's just my opinion. Now, the other thing was the demographic of the women on my show. Guys, I haven't done recruiting in months. So when I started one, I never expected it to blow up this fast. I never in my life thought I'd have a million subscribers in a year. I wrote my goals for the year before and it was 100,000. I thought I'd maybe get 100K by the end of the year. Okay, that's what I thought. Now everything blew up so fast. And I haven't done recruiting since maybe July. The only time I have is maybe to help out if we're low on a show. So like, or there's a really big panel, like the Andrew T panel, I handpicked everyone that was on that. But in general, guys, I really don't recruit. I think one reason that there have been so many Black people on the show is because the recruiter that I picked was Nigerian. And he just had the type of job that he could recruit while he went on the job. And he knew a lot of people. He was already in the podcast space. So he's just a good recruiter. So it makes sense that he knows more Nigerian women. Yeah, okay. But again, yeah. The next part. Now this was the part that was probably the dumbest part of the whole interview. This was the stupidest, the dumbest, dumbest, dumbest, dumbest. Oh, this was stupid. So I said that slavery was embellished in the interview. Now that not only is that comment insensitive, it's not accurate. There were things in slavery that were worse than what was shown on TV. What I was referring to, I really don't even want to tell you guys what I was trying to say because it wasn't what came out and it doesn't even matter. Again, if you watch the full thing, I was more referring to the system of using atrocities to control people. That's what I was trying to say. But to say that it wasn't that it was embellished is so stupid, so stupid, insensitive. And I know I'm sure I've read a couple books, but I'm not informed or qualified enough to really have that conversation. So not bringing someone else onto the show. Again, stupid. Now the next thing is that my friend Gabi came on the show with him and she's dating someone that is black. And he would say openly racist comments to her. Now, I should have pushed back on that. Like I've been an interracial relationship. So for me to not push back on that, especially with all of the people that have been on my show was stupid. It was stupid. I was kind of like a deer in the head lights. I didn't know what to say. Oh gosh. And the video we were watching wasn't even supposed to be about that. So I really don't have an excuse. It was just stupid. And again, I take full accountability for this stuff. And if I had to do it over again, I would do it differently, but I can only move forward. So I want to make sure that I addressed everything. I think I did. I think I did. Okay. Because I talked about recruiting. I talked about. Okay. So moving forward, I really would be open to having a discussion with someone that can bring more awareness and education to the situation. So I'm open to you guys' suggestions in the comments. I also invite anybody that's made a video about me or has comments to address with me to go on Obsidian Stream tonight. It's 8 p.m. GMT. Blessing will also be there. And yeah, you know, because I don't want to run from this stuff. Again, a lot of this stuff was not well thought out. A lot of this stuff I could have done better and I do take full accountability for that. So, you know, go on the stream if you got something to say. I also would like to say I really don't have beef with anyone in the space that made videos about me. I understand where they were coming from. I understand where I went wrong. And I really think they had a lot of valid criticisms about me. So let me know what you guys think. I really did my best to address all of the comments in a concise way. I'm not trying to play the victim. Everything in this that has happened is my fault. And I'm just, yeah, my fault. And I will do better in the future. So let me know in the comments what you guys think. Like the video on your way out. I guess or don't. You know, you can just, they don't have a dislike button anymore. But anyways, thank you for watching guys. I'll see you on Obsidian's channel tonight."
080_Joe,"I'm trying to think. We're dead. Very, very dead. I would say today is probably the worst day we've ever had in war zone history. So basically today, as all of us know that the new season was supposed to drop today, and prior to this new season, we had a call with the developers and stuff like we usually have, and we're promised a lot of things. We didn't get to play the update before everybody else, so we got to see everything when you guys got to see everything. So when we were hearing from the developers that all these things were being changed, it was very, very promising. And while I was thinking, and like everybody else was also thinking that the game and the developers would deliver on that promise of all these changes. And then when the season came out, and all of us actually played, we realized a lot of the things that they promised did not happen. Which then a lot of people took that to social media and then kind of used creators as a scapegoat, because I thought that the game was looking in the right direction because of the things we were promised. I don't really mind trolls that much. Trolls will always just be a thing. It's the internet. But when I have other creator friends and people that I consider my friends creators, that are quoting my tweets, calling me out, poking fun at things as they're just, it's just jokes. It's the internet. People don't get jokes. People don't understand sarcasm. So it just kind of routed me the wrong way that there's other creators that are trying to point the fingers at people like myself for a bad update. We heard the same thing. We were all promised the same thing. And now somehow it got turned to be my fault and other creators faults. And that just really kind of blew my mind that it seemed like a lot of people were trying to get on the good side of Twitter and be like, oh, this isn't me. I would have never done that. They didn't do the same thing. For every single update and be like, oh, I didn't gas up this update. The same people that do it every season. They're so adamant about them just being right about this update. They don't really want the game to improve. People don't even want the game to improve. They just want to complain. If the update was incredible, people would have found something to complain about. And I feel like today was probably the worst moment for the Wars Outer community. I've seen in a very long time. Again, the trolls don't really bother me, but seeing like mutual friends that are saying things on stream, sending hate to be like, go tell Joe. Like, he's an idiot. And like, this is all his fault. To say that. And then it happened to be like, oh, we were just jokes. Just blows my mind. And I feel like my friends that our creators should know way better than that. I mean, honestly, overall, just streaming the game all day, trying to kind of see the game as a positive way. Maybe things could get fixed and just seeing negative vibes of people, negative vibes of chat and just people that just are saying the most out of pocket reckless things over a call of duty update that we all wanted to be good. And I know there's a lot of people that is usually the silent majority of people that really don't care. They just play the game for fun, which I completely understand that. And I'm glad that you guys are probably happy. And either way, you guys are going to be happy. And you just play the game, which is incredible. But I know there's the other side of myself included that's very, very passionate about the game. And that's why we're very vocal. And people keep saying you're doing this to get paid. We get zero. Zero big fat zero dollars from call of duty. We, I don't know where this narrative came from. The creators are getting paid. We didn't even get creator code. We don't have a creator code. Creator codes have been done since Warzone 1. That was the only funding from call of duty that we've ever gotten besides tournaments that we won. There is zero dollars being funded to creators that are on these developer calls. I don't know where that narrative came from. But we are getting no money from call of duty. I'm so vocal about it because I want the game to be good. I don't know anybody that is just going to sit back and be like the game is great and just let bad things happen or not voice opinions. And people say, well, you're just playing a game, bro. Like blah blah blah blah, which I do understand that. I think anybody would be a fool to say that they would not actually voice an opinion about something that's their career. If you do something 10 hours a day and you know that something could work better, you're going to voice your opinion to your boss, to your job, to whoever, because you know, hey, this is, I do this all day every day. And that's why I'm so vocal about, hey, this should be changed. We should fix this. Let's approach this differently instead of just sitting back and being like everybody else and being like the game is great. Now you can ask anybody that is actually sat with me at a table with the call of duty developers. I'm one of the most vocal people ever and I tell them how it is and say, this is why your game is bad. Now, whether they listen to me or not, I know that I'm 0.00001 percent. That's on them. But I'm never going to sugarcoat if something is bad like this update was bad. And I think that sending hate to creators that were being optimistic about something that we were told, we didn't get to play season 30. I see people saying, you got to play it, you should know, we didn't get to play it. We played the update the same time as you guys did. So when we're being told things, you would think that what we're being told would actually be true when the update drops. And then to be getting death threats saying that I hope that your mom dies of cancer like your dad did. Like, what are we doing? Like, how have we gotten so far from playing a video game, my call of duty that we all love and enjoy to then sending death threats to people? Today was definitely probably the worst update or most over promise update we've ever had. And I hope that call of duty does something to fix this because we have ranked play coming in under a month. We have no TTK improvements like we thought that we would. The movement changes that we were promised don't seem like they were very promised. And all these updates servers included and were just didn't happen. And we had multiple updates throughout the day that added stuff back in that should have already been in the update. And we have a $1.2 million tournament coming up and we can't even load into a private match. I mean, it just blows our mind that the game has gotten to this, but I don't even know what to expect or say anymore. If you were able to have just a straight up one-on-one right now of call of duty, what would you say? You know what I mean? I would say first steps the patch on us today as all of us saw them were very vague. When we're seeing things like movement and outplayability is now going to be in this season, that sure sounds like we're getting an incredible, incredible, buffed, and movement outplayability. Those notes should be very specific of what's going on. It should not be vague. I saw some people like, well, it was open to interpretation, okay, but it's been patched notes, though. This is the facts of what's going on in the patch. It shouldn't be open to interpretation. It should be this is what's going on. This is what's changing exact word for word. And not you guys can kind of decide on your own what you think that'll mean. You just fly out, think it should give me a little play test because it's 100%. I feel like honestly every update, but especially this update, it blows my mind. And again, I don't code, so I'm not saying that I'm a professional computer coder if I did this not at all, but your billion dollar company and they're just missing the most simple things in the game. It seems like that that their own developers don't even play. They're not even play testing. What they should do is, and I'm not saying that creators should get special treatment, but I'm trying to be a voice for everybody. I'm not saying bring back slide, canceling, and everything else. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying to prove the game overall, they should have creators play testing the game, and I guarantee you in under 30 minutes, I could have had a list of things that should have been fixed before this update even dropped. I saw a lot of people saying, why is it ranked playing here for season three? I'm like, before ranked play comes out, I hope they fix all the bugs. I was before even the update came out. I said, I'm glad it's waiting because I already know when the season drops, all the bugs that we've always had, it's going to happen again. If you were just doing kind of the same thing over and over every day, which I'm assuming the devs are doing kind of changing up the game and things like that, you're going to miss things in our own lives if we're doing the same thing every every single day, and someone like a friend or family kind of sees that from an outside perspective, you may miss something that you're doing wrong every day, but they could see it instantly, because you're just in the normal vibe of your work or your day or your kind of life routine. But if they're at work doing the normal kind of routine of what they're doing, they may miss certain things that somebody else could catch in an instant that aren't doing their job. And that happens outside of gaming in life when you're just going through the same things every single day or trying to do something and that somebody else comes in and they see a new perspective, then it could click and be like, oh, I didn't even notice that until you pointed it out. And I think that's why they need to have creators play testing early. So things like this don't happen. Call of duty, I am very disappointed in what we were told and what I fell for and a lot of people did to so for the people that are saying that I'm a sellout and all that, I apologize if you think that. Sorry for the people that listened to what I was I was promised and took that for words for word. And sorry to the people that expected more of season three. I don't work for the game so I wish that I could kind of vouch for it better or get more things changed that I would like to have changed. But I guess going from here, I'm going to be I guess the glass half empty type of person when it comes to call duty updates, everything else, I'll be the glass half full positive person. As this is probably the most not negative vibe video, but just kind of sit down video we've ever had on the channel regarding a game that all of us love to be honest. And I try to not even kind of see the trolls and all the all the just BS drama and and all that anyway because at the end of the day, we're all playing a video game that we love. All of us have loved Warzone since the pandemic. All the creators that are having drama and moaning and complaining and and everything else like we're literally having a dream job. We get to play video games for a living and that is because of you guys supporting us. And for the last thing for the video, the people that showed me love today, you guys know you guys mean the literal world to me. I can never say that enough even though it's kind of a you know down video. Overall, the people that either comment on videos like this one show up in Shrine, send me DMs, responses like that means more to me than you guys will ever know. And I think that does very very silent minority of people that complain, got the best of a lot of people today and of creators today. And the people that are usually just like yo, Joe, we love you. If the game's trash, we still love you. If it's if it's amazing, we love you. So I feel like that's the majority of people. So thank you guys. You guys mean the freaking world to me and I say that all the time. I mean it. You guys have blessed me to literally get to do something that I love to do every single day and have it as a full-time career. And I'm blessed, unbelievably blessed to say that and that's because of you guys. So thank you always. Fives up. See you guys soon. Peace."
